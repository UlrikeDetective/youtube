Philip Guston thought hard about the artist's responsibility to bear witness to ‘the brutality of the world‘. Consistently changing and reinventing, he sought to make work that embodies life’s complexities, its beauty, absurdity, humour and suffering. In this short film, curators Michael Wellen and Michael Raymond, conservator Anna Cooper and the artist's daughter, Musa Mayer, recount the story of Guston's life and career, as well as his restless urge to challenge himself creatively. This film was created as part of the Terra Foundation for American Art Series: New Perspectives. It includes extracts from the following documentaries: Philip Guston: A Life Lived, directed by Michael Blackwood (New York: Michael Blackwood Productions, 1981).

Forced to leave Germany in 1933, Adler spent the rest of the decade moving through various cities in Europe. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the Polish Army in France. In 1940 he was evacuated to Scotland and spent the remainder of his life in the UK. His sketchbooks cover the period of 1933-49 and help us trace the development of his artistic style throughout this tumultuous period. They allowed Adler to work when his itinerant existence kept him from easels and canvas, with many pages filled with studies and ideas which would be later worked into finished pieces. In this short film, David Aukin and Glenn Sujo explore the sketchbooks in more detail. The sketchbooks were catalogued and digitised as part of the Émigré Art Archives Project, generously funded by the Marie-Louise von Motesiczky Charitable Trust.

In this short film, Cina Aissa, Learning Assistant at Tate, takes a closer look at the work. Speaking about her personal discovery of Adnan, Cina says: ""With her heritage spanning Greece, Lebanon and Syria, Adnan brings in other languages, cultures and points of view into her prolific works across literature, poetry and visual arts. I had never heard of her even though she is still alive and practising art well into her 90s. Feminist artists such as the Guerrilla Girls are celebrated for their work in fighting for the equal representation of women in art galleries, but for me this conversation only scratches the surface. When it comes to the experience of women of colour, we are struggling for so much more than simply to be treated equally to men -- we are struggling for our humanity. Many women of colour have to endure poverty while undertaking unpaid care and service work, all against the backdrop of a racist society. When women of colour do create art and build prolific careers, like Adnan, it’s rare that they become household names. Why haven’t more people heard of Etel Adnan? I was so excited to discover Adnan but also sad and angry to see how little she has been spoken of.

Nupur invites us into what appears to be a cosy domestic space. However, its colonial-era style evokes histories of violence in South Asia. The tablecloth is embroidered with an 1886 map of the British Empire. The napkins are stitched with opium flowers, a crop that farmers were forced to grow by the British East India Company, often for no profit. The artist herself wears a costume combining traditional Bangladeshi and British elements. On the walls are images of tea bushes, applied with a mixture of sugar and tea. While emphasising the comforting role of tea- drinking in Britain and South Asia, the work also asks us to reflect on the impact of British imperialism and colonialism. The performance Let Me Get You a Nice Cup of Tea took place at Tate Modern in October 2022.

This footage was filmed in December 2020. Jimmie Durham was born in 1940 in the US. Durham’s art incorporates a range of media and processes such as sculptural assemblage, painting, drawing, collage, printmaking, photography, video, performance and poetry. Many of Durham's include whatever materials were near to hand, and accessible for the artist, including stone, wood and animal bones and hides, alongside car parts, plastic and metal pipe, glass and other detritus of the modern world. In 1994 Durham returned to Europe and remained there for the rest of his life, living and working in several different cities including Dublin, Rome and Berlin. In Europe his work often focused on the deconstruction of national identities and an analysis of the narratives, architecture and monuments relating to them. Durham died in Berlin on 17 November 2021, aged 81.;Tate,Tate Modern,Tate Britain,Tate Liverpool,Tate St Ives,Art,Modern Art,Contemporary Art,British Art;27;Education;Hobby,Lifestyle_(sociology);PT5M44S;344;2d;hd;FALSE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aCYsx8_KVy4/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;22498;645;;0;26

From his early self-portraits, to his landscapes, Cezanne's artwork gave painting a new lease of life. The history of painting was never to be the same again. We look at Cezanne in the context of his time, exploring his life and the creative circle that surrounded him, as well as his groups of works that focus on particular themes, including his radical still lifes and studies of bathers. Cezanne's work has always strongly resonated with other artists, and this legacy continues into the present day.

They seemed like coats or cocoons that tempted you to crawl inside, or hairy living creatures suspended from the gallery ceiling. The critics did not know what to make of them and called them 'Abakans' - perhaps the only example of an art form named after their artist. In this film, curator Ann Coxon leads us through a 'forest' of these towering Abakans, exploring how Abakanowicz pioneered a whole new form of installation art. Magdalena Abakanowicz: Every Tangle of Thread and Rope is at Tate Modern until 21 May 2023.

About the artwork, John says: ""Lately, I’ve had some unexpected conversations. They start out as guided tours – where I do all the talking – but then something happens. People start to chat amongst themselves. That’s often the case with ‘Condition Report’ by Glenn Ligon. When talked about, this work provokes further reaction and discussion. The work is based on signs carried by Black sanitation workers who were on strike in Memphis in 1968. Ligon shows twice the workers’ slogan ‘I AM A MAN’ along with some scribbly handwritten notes. Art and history, then, according to Ligon, are subject to changing conditions. Art and history are far from static or fixed. Art and history can be re-thought as time goes by. Thanks to Ligon, I’m conducting my guided tours in a new way. His artwork is allowing me to start open discussions on a range of related issues and this work is teaching me to listen. It’s teaching me to be like the artwork itself, open to change and open to various, unexpected reactions.""

Ever since a child, walking has been a way for her to better understand this complex city, which she describes as a ""living organism"". In this film, we join Büyüktaşçıyan on her daily commute from the island of Heybeliada. Arriving in the city, she explores the old district of Fatih, encountering and observing paper collectors and carpet sellers, Byzantine churches converted into Ottoman mosques. In a visit to her studio, we see how the constant layering of histories, communities and acts of resistance in Istanbul – and in other cities like Toronto and Lahore – inspires her artwork, which ranges from forests of coiled carpets to stop-motion animation and drawing.

Sharon Hayes | Tate;Watch an in-depth visual description of this work by multimedia artist Sharon Hayes. Five loudspeakers stand facing five posters, reciting letters to unnamed lovers. The letters are highly emotional and intimate fraught with despair desire and longing. She speaks about her sense of helplessness during the unfolding invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, the trauma and dislocation of living in a moment of war as a U.S. citizen and feeling dislocated from her daily life. The letters do not specify the sexuality of the writer or their lover. For the performances, however, Hayes has said that she ‘butched myself up even more than usual because I didn’t want the love to be read as heteronormative.’ This audio description was written and recorded by Chris Timms, Retail Assistant at Tate.

Sin’s practice pivots around the use of speculative fiction within performance, moving image, writing and print, to question the idealised image and the collective gaze. Identifying as mixed race and non-binary, their work creates fantasy narratives, to interrupt normative processes around issues of desire, identification, and objectification. Sin’s use of performance and particularly drag began as a means of deconstructing and challenging misogyny and racism in and outside of the queer community.

They are brushing grains of rice into patterns. They are creating a winding labyrinth-like path. The dancers are performers in Lee Mingwei's Our Labyrinth, an artwork that brings a sense of ritual into the museum. It was inspired by Lee's experience of visiting ancient temples in Myanmar, where paths leading to temples are swept by volunteers. In this film we meet the artist and introduce his beautiful, participatory works. Lee creates installations exploring issues such as trust, intimacy, and self-awareness. He often takes everyday interactions as his starting point, from eating and sleeping to walking and conversation.

The idea that there exists a culture which is African, American, Caribbean, and British, all at once, has generated the rich and boundless space that is Black Atlantic thinking. This series explores Tate's collection and the impact of the Atlantic slave trade through the lens of the Black Atlantic. It gives an accessible introduction to the Black Atlantic, how it can help us to understand British identity and how we can acknowledge and learn from history to look towards the future.

What advice would she give to herself as a young artist? Why is she so drawn to chalk as an artistic medium? And which building would she like to blow up next? Cornelia Parker is one of Britain's best loved and most acclaimed contemporary artists. Always driven by curiosity, she reconfigures domestic objects to question our relationship with the world. Using transformation, playfulness and storytelling, she engages with important issues of our time, be it violence, ecology or human rights.

Watch the group discuss the ways in which artists and photographers have approached the subject, whether through the anonymous landscape paintings of JMW Turner or the more sensitive portraits of Laura Knight and Chris Killip. Delaine Le Bas also takes us into the heart of the West Sussex countryside, which inspired her new performance and installation Rinkeni Pani 2022. The title of the work is English Romani for ‘beautiful water’ and refers to both her great grandmother - who urged Le Bas never to waste precious water – as well as the increasing lack of access to water experienced by populations in the face of climate emergency. A note on language This film includes contributions from, and discussion of artworks featuring depictions of people who belong to ethnic British Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities. ‘Gypsy, Roma and Traveller’ is an umbrella term that includes many different and distinct groups, including Irish Traveller, Roma and Romani Gypsy people who are all recognised as ethnic minority groups under the Race Equality Act 2010. In addition, this catchall term can include New Travellers, Showpeople and Boaters because they practice nomadism as a lifestyle choice. These communities are not recognised as ethnic minority groups. Policymakers often use ‘GRT’ as shorthand, however, this can damage the visibility of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people when used out of context. In some countries the term ‘Gypsy’ has been used widely as a racial slur and a derogatory or dehumanising word. However, there are Romani groups in Europe who have claimed this word and use it with pride. This includes many Romani individuals within the UK who proudly use the word ‘Gypsy’ to describe themselves. As with any identity signifiers, it’s always best to ask individuals how they identify and to use their preferred terminology.

Like other media art, net art works were often created by artists without the need for art institutions. What is the relationship between net art and the museum now? How does a museum approach collecting and caring for internet artworks? Uncovering the histories of these works is challenging, as technologies become defunct, web domains expire and other records are lost in website upgrades and server migrations. In this short film, we hear from artists, curators and conservators, who explore the lives of these fascinating and challenging artworks. Support for the creation of this film was provided by a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

DeLuxe is a grid of sixty individually-framed prints. The imagery is based on magazines dating from the 1930s to the 1970s aimed at African-American audiences, many of which feature advertisements for ‘improvements’ including wigs, hair pomades and skin bleaching creams. Gallagher transformed these images using a variety of printing techniques, combining traditional processes of etching and lithography with recent developments in digital technology. She also made modifications by cutting and layering images and text and adding a range of materials including plasticine, glitter, gold leaf, toy eyeballs and coconut oil. Her witty and sophisticated interventions emphasise the complex construction of identity.

We are grateful to the following collectives and the innumerable others whose work makes this film possible. Amber Film and Photography collective have been embedded within Newcastle’s working class community for over half a century. Their building houses an independent cinema, gallery, film production company and international photographic archive allowing them to control the production and distribution of their socially engaged work. Art Boyz is a collective of young Londoners made up of friends Anayo Nkwocha, Yvonne Shelling & Amardeep Sura. The self-appointed family pooled their resources to push their careers in the arts to the next level. Their counter-cultural work seeks to exceed the limits of fine art and straddles music, sculpture, fashion and youth work. Baesianz is a collective and platform based in London, that celebrates Asian artists from all over the globe. Founded by Sami Kimberley, Sarah Khan and Roxanne Farahmand, their work is inclusive of all Asian heritage identities, including mixed heritage, Asians, trans, queer and gender non-conforming Asians. Cooking Sections was formed in 2013 by Alon Schwabe & Daniel Fernández Pascual after an architecture programme led them to think about food as a tool to investigate the construction of space. Since then, their expansive approach to exhibition making has brought a wide range of environmentally engaged expertise to their practice. Alongside art practice they lead a studio unit at Royal College of Art’s School of Architecture. Project Art Works is a collective based in Hastings since 1997. Their collaborative fusion of art and care challenges traditional approaches to inclusion. Working with neurodiverse artists and makers, Project Art Works reimagines the boundaries of what a socially engaged charity, community organisation and artists studio can be. Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries is a Seoul based web art collective that fuses multimedia software, original music and poetry to channel their artistic impulses. Ever responsive, ever irreverent, their work has travelled the world to be experienced in online and traditional gallery spaces. In their fourth decade of collaboration, the group remains as prolific and consistent as ever.

The state expresses the unease of the army's equivocal position between the two warring groups in Northern Ireland, and the dual role the soldiers must play. The soldier is at once gun-wielding and defensive. Hamilton wanted to create the effect, in this picture, of the soldier walking backwards. It is a customary practice for British soldiers patrolling in Northern Ireland to walk back to back, some 100 yards apart, to ensure that they are covered in both directions. This idea also relates to the artist's perception that the British wish to get out of Northern Ireland. He represents the soldier as young and reluctant, a 'conscript'. Before Hamilton's birth, his father served in the British army during an earlier phase of the Irish troubles and conveyed to his son a sense of the warmth of the Irish people.

Kitaj's painting of The Wedding | Tate;This painting depicts the wedding of Kitaj and the American artist Sandra Fisher (1947-94) which took place in 1983, some six years before this painting was begun.    The artwork features depictions of several important figures of the British artworld including Lucien Freud, Frank Auerbach and David Hockney.  Kitaj said of the work:  I worked on the painting for years and never learned how to finish it even though painter friends, including most of those in the picture, gave me good advice about it which I took up and changed things all the time. In the end, instead of finishing it, I finished with it and gave it away to a deserving old friend.  Kitaj has described Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon as 'the most important influence' on this picture, 'not a source but a hovering presence'. The Wedding brings together several crucial themes in Kitaj's art and thought, including his increasing awareness of his identity as a Jew.   This is a short video introduction to a work on display at Tate Modern.

He was fascinated by the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome. In his paintings he often referred to historical or mythological figures, or included fragments of classical poetry. The three paintings in this series are named after Bacchus, the Roman God of wine and intoxication, known to the Greeks as Dionysus. They were made with a brush attached to the end of a pole, enabling Twombly to capture the energy of an unbroken movement across a large canvas. The brush was soaked in paint, which dripped down the canvas, its red colour evoking both wine and blood. This is a short video introduction to a work on display at Tate Modern.

The expansive skies and landscapes of the area have long been a draw for artists, most famously painters associated with the Newlyn school such as Laura Knight, Alfred Munnings and Lamorna Birch. Less well known are the ground-breaking queer artists who set down roots in the village: Marlow Moss, Gluck and Ithell Colquhoun. In this film, we tell their story, and the story of the Cornwall where they lived and loved: a place of international modernism, Celtic spiritualism and the queer avant-garde. A Note on Language: Telling the stories of these three artists asks us to consider our concepts of gender and sexuality, and how we perceive and represent queer figures of the past. The word ‘queer’ itself has a mixed history, used both as a term of abuse and as a term by LGBTQIA+ people to refer to themselves. In recent times, it has become reclaimed as a fluid term for people of different sexualities and gender identities. In this film, we use ‘queer’ in this broad and inclusive sense, rather than making specific assumptions about how these artists would choose to identify. Similarly, while Moss and Gluck may have been happy being described with the binary pronouns of their time, we can never be sure. It’s impossible to know whether these artists would today identify as genderqueer, non-binary, trans, butch and/or lesbian. In this film, we use neutral pronouns when referring to them. This is an option that honours all possibilities, and draws no conclusions.  Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Tate,Tate Modern,Tate Britain,Tate Liverpool,Tate St Ives,Art,Modern Art,Contemporary Art,British Art,Marlow Moss,Gluck,Ithell Colquhoun;27;Education;Hobby,Lifestyle_(sociology);PT12M26S;746;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uaOUpC2Dzgw/maxresdefault.jpg;1;;;;20022;690;;0;23

It overturned ‘terra nullius’, a Latin expression meaning ‘land belonging to nobody’. This doctrine had stated that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples did not own the territory they occupied for many thousands of years. The British used this principle to justify taking over the land now known as Australia in 1770. In this film, we explore artworks made before and after 1992 that examine the continuing relationship that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have with their lands. Many of these works reflect on the ongoing impact of colonisation, the complexities of representation in Australian society today and questions of social and environmental injustice. Tate acknowledges and pays respect to the Traditional Owners of Country throughout Australia and recognises the continuing connection to lands, waters and communities. We pay our respect to the Elders of these lands and acknowledge the continuation of cultural, spiritual and educational practices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. You can discover work by some of the artists featured in this film in A Year in Art: Australia 1992, a free exhibition at Tate Modern.

The press speculated about transmissions from UFOs or other supernatural events, but Hiller recognised what all these explanations refused to acknowledge, which was the innate power of human imagination. Hiller made adjustments to Belshazzar’s Feast over her life and different versions have sometimes existed at the same time.

In 1974, aged 17, Neshat moved from Iran to the United States to study art at the University of California, Berkeley. During her absence, the country became an Islamic republic following the 1979 revolution. On returning in 1990, she was struck by the cultural and political changes that had taken place, one significant change being the introduction of laws requiring women to dress according to Islamic tradition. This experience led Neshat to explore gender in Islamic societies, with the veil becoming a central image in her photographic and video work.

This exhibition brings together around 80 works from 2003 to the present day in the most extensive survey of the artist’s career to date. The figures in Yiadom-Boakye’s paintings are not real people – she creates them from found images and her own imagination. Both familiar and mysterious, they invite viewers to project their own interpretations, and raise important questions of identity and representation. Often painted in spontaneous and instinctive bursts, her figures seem to exist outside of a specific time or place. Her paintings are coupled with poetic titles, such as Tie the Temptress to the Trojan 2016 and To Improvise a Mountain 2018. Writing is central to Yiadom-Boakye’s artistic practice, as she has explained: ‘I write about the things I can’t paint and paint the things I can’t write about.’ Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Tate,Tate Modern,Tate Britain,Tate Liverpool,Tate St Ives,Art,Modern Art,Contemporary Art,British Art;27;Education;Hobby,Lifestyle_(sociology);PT11M12S;672;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ee5gGkW7nk/maxresdefault.jpg;1;;;;72904;2116;;0;49

How can a museum attempt to conserve a performance? Join members of Tate’s Time-Based Media Conservation team, curators and researchers from Tate’s Reshaping the Collectible Research team as they attempt to conserve and re-stage avant-garde artist Tony Conrad's Ten Years Alive on the Infinite Plain, a performance artwork comprising of 16mm film, projectors, and several musical instruments. Tony Conrad is no longer alive, and the artwork didn’t have a written score for future performances. The Reshaping the Collectible project team brought together past performers of the artwork and a new set of performers to produce a new score, as well as working together to re-perform 10 Years Alive on the Infinite Plain at Tate Liverpool as part of the annual LightNight festival in May 2019. Reshaping the Collectible: When Artworks Live in the Museum is a major research project focused on recent and contemporary artworks which challenge the practices of the museum. Responding to Tate’s bold acquisition policy and building on its pioneering research and expertise in this field, the project is contributing to theory and practice in collection care, curation and museum management. Support for the creation of this film was provided by a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

Beardsley shocked and delighted Victorian London with his black and white drawings. In fact, the 1890s even became known in some circles as the ‘Beardsley Period’. At the centre of this decadent world was the ‘dandy’, an elegant and enigmatic character made famous by Beardsley and friends like Oscar Wilde.

Created by artist Kara Walker for the 2019 Hyundai Commission, it is one of the most ambitious installations in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall to date. Rather than a celebration of the British Empire, Walker’s fountain explores the interconnected histories of Africa, America and Europe. She uses water as a key theme, referring to the transatlantic slave trade and the ambitions, fates and tragedies of people from these three continents. Fantasy, fact and fiction meet at an epic scale. Based in New York, Kara Walker is acclaimed for her candid explorations of race, sexuality and violence. She is best known for her use of black cut-paper silhouetted figures, referencing the history of slavery and the antebellum South in the US through provocative and elaborate installations. Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall has hosted some of the world’s most memorable and acclaimed large-scale works of art, enjoyed by audiences of millions each year. This is the fifth installation in the ten-year series of the Hyundai Commission following the work of Abraham Cruzvillegas in 2015, Philippe Parreno in 2016, SUPERFLEX in 2017 and Tania Bruguera in 2018. Fons Americanus is on display at Tate Modern until 5 April 2020.

Haring was a great collaborator and worked with like-minded artists such as Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. All were interested in creating art for the many. Haring designed record covers for RUN DMC and David Bowie, directed a music video for Grace Jones and developed a fashion line with Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood. In doing so, he introduced his art and ideas to as many people as possible.

Harding was born in 1982 in Moranbah, Queensland. The artist is a Bidjara, Ghungalu and Garingbal man who currently lives and works in Brisbane, Queensland. Harding works with a variety of techniques and traditions including painting, installation and sculpture. Recently, Harding has created wall-based art inspired by rock art sites in Queensland. ‘The landscape was the gallery that my ancestors knew’, the artist says. ‘Working directly on gallery walls is an acknowledgment and continuation of painting stories on sandstone walls.’ Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Tate,Tate Modern,Tate Britain,Art,Modern Art,Contemporary Art,British Art,dale harding,australia,aboriginal,queensland,Bidjara,Garingbal,artist,interview;27;Education;Knowledge;PT4M57S;297;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-EA77G9UKIc/maxresdefault.jpg;1;;;;29271;593;;0;18

Working with photography, film and painting, the artist’s career spans more than five decades. See the largest UK exhibition of this influential artist, teacher, and curator at Tate Modern until 5 July 2020. Free entry: https://bit.ly/2m4WM2Q Throughout her career, Dóra Maurer has been at the centre of a community of Hungarian artists championing culture outside of the official socialist system. This community has been responsible for organising exhibitions in apartments and publishing underground journals. Trained as a graphic artist in the 1950s, Maurer pushed the medium to its limit by experimenting. In the 1970s she started to work in photography and moving image, alongside working with musicians and teaching preformative workshops. She developed geometric and abstract drawings and paintings in the 1970s and beyond. Movement, perception and transformation have been consistent to her work. Never tied down to one medium, Maurer's unique voice is constantly evolving.

Born in 1945, Finn-Kelcey used a wide range of styles, media, and materials to install political works in public spaces. Like many artists from the 1960s and 1970s, the artist was interested in ephemeral events instead of lasting objects. Humour was also key to Rose Finn-Kelcey’s work, who used it as a tool to tackle serious topics. ‘If there isn’t any humour in the work, then I feel something is wrong’, the artist said.

Frank Bowling was born in Guyana and moved to London to study Fine Art at the Royal Academy. To this day he continues to make work from his studios in London and New York. His paintings use a variety of bright acrylic paint colours and embedded objects that create unusual but mesmerising compositions. Two of his most well-known paintings in Tate's collection include 'Spreadout Ron Kitaj' and 'Sasha Jason Guyana Dreams'. Both of these paintings show how Bowling layers paint to create a deeply textured feel to his artworks. Bowling’s Studio Assistant, Spencer A.

Natalia Goncharova blazed a trail with her experimental approach to art and design. Aged just 32 she established herself as the leader of the Russian avant-garde with a major exhibition in Moscow in 1913. Goncharova moved to France where she designed costumes and backdrops for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballet Russes. She lived in Paris for the rest of her life, becoming a key figure in the city’s cutting-edge art scene. Goncharova’s artistic output was immense, wide-ranging and at times controversial. She paraded the streets of Moscow displaying futurist body art and created monumental religious paintings. She took part in avant-garde cinema, experimented with book designs and designed for fashion houses in Moscow and Paris. Her bold and innovative body of work influenced and transcended the art movements of the 20th century.

The work is made up of a truck, a section of concrete wall, video and other materials. ‘The whole thing started with a photograph of graffiti with an image of Augusto Calderón Sandino’, explains Salmerón. ‘He was used as an icon for a new revolutionary movement in the 1970s.’ After learning that the attached building was to be demolished, Salmerón excavated the graffiti in 2006 and installed it into the back of a former military truck. A relic of the revolution, the truck was sent by the German Democratic Republic to Nicaragua in support of the Sandinistas’ socialist cause. ‘This truck is a testimony to political conflict’, says Salmerón. Now exhibited in public spaces like Tate Modern, the wall and truck have travelled great distances from their original contexts. They raise questions about the revolutionary ideas they symbolise and how those ideas move and transform over time. 19 July marks Nicaragua Liberation Day when the Sandinista National Liberation Front overthrew a dictatorship regime, replacing it with a form of socialist government. Some of its leaders remain in power today.

The Berlin-based Venezuelan artist Sol Calero uses visual clichés of Latin America in her work, as seen by the ‘Western eye’. Her installations are filled with colourful patterns and textiles which give the space a surreal quality. Calero aims to ‘shake the space so people forget where they are’. Calero’s new installation at Tate Liverpool, ‘El Autobús’ 2019, is inspired by a trip to Latin America. There, richly decorated buses are a popular means of transport. For locals, the bus is a necessary part of the daily commute, while tourists use them in pursuit of exotic adventure. Calero explores this tension in an imaginary audio-visual guided tour. Despite growing up in Venezuela, ‘it has nothing to do with the reality that is the country right now,’ says the artist. ‘I’m from a place but that place doesn’t exist anymore’. Travelling to Latin America ‘was quite a shock’ for the artist, who found herself ‘also going with a different perception of what the place was.’ For Calero, the opportunity to create art as a female Latin American artist ‘is what keeps me moving.’ ‘Not everyone is given the opportunity, which is quite unfair’, says Calero. ‘Because if we were all making more art, if we were all thinking more creatively, I like to think it’s maybe a better world.’ See Sol Calero’s El Autobús at Tate Liverpool until 10 November 2019: https://bit.ly/2X8bzXq Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Tate,Tate Liverpool,Tate St Ives,Art,Modern Art,Contemporary Art,arte latino,venezuela,sol calero,artista latina americana,tropical,installation,el autobus,latin america,migration,immigration;27;Education;Hobby,Lifestyle_(sociology);PT5M23S;323;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;;;;;;17576;310;;0;11

VALIE was a mother and a housewife before beginning her artistic career when she moved to Vienna in the Sixties. ‘Feminism at the time allowed you to choose who you are’ says EXPORT. Born as Waltraud Lehner, and later Waltraud Höllinger, in 1967, the artist dropped her father’s and husband’s names to create her new identity as VALIE EXPORT, which became her trademark.

Dorothea Tanning was an American surrealist artist whose career spanned over seven decades. Self-taught, her early paintings depict with precision dream-like scenes. Sunflowers, chess pieces, fabric, and doors, always slightly ajar, recur in her work. Dorothea says she ‘got fed up with the turpentine’ and in the 1960s began working with fabric, pioneering the use of soft sculptures.

The EY Exhibition: Van Gogh and Britain presents the largest collection of Van Gogh’s paintings in the UK for nearly a decade. Some of his most famous works will be brought together from around the world – including Shoes, Starry Night on the Rhône, L'Arlésienne, and two works he made while a patient at the Saint-Paul Asylum, At Eternity’s Gate and Prisoners Exercising. They will be joined by the very rarely lent Sunflowers from London’s National Gallery. Van Gogh lived in England as a young man for several crucial years. He walked the streets alone, dreaming of the future. He fell in love with British culture, especially the novels of Charles Dickens and George Eliot. And he was inspired by the art he saw here, including paintings by Constable and Millais which are featured in the exhibition. They affected his paintings throughout his career. The exhibition also looks at the British artists who were inspired by Van Gogh, including Francis Bacon, David Bomberg, and the young Camden Town painters. It shows how his vision set British artists on the road to modern art.

In the early 1960s Liliane Lijn was at the forefront of exploring new ways of using technology and materials to make art. Surrealism, Greek mythology, female identity and developments in technology are just some of the things that have inspired the artist. 'I try to make work that will allow people to still their mind and look at things with a different eye', says Lijn.

The Brazilian artist Hélio Oiticica challenged the traditional boundaries of art. He made the viewer an active participant in his work, now seen as a major moment in the development of contemporary art. Hélio Oiticica was part of the Tropicália movement in Brazil, spanning the visual arts, music and film. The term Tropicália was first given to a pair of installations by Oiticica, a song by Caetano Veloso, and an LP released in 1968, featuring artists such as Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa and the psychedelic band Os Mutantes. The 1960s saw an explosion of cultural creativity in Rio de Janerio and São Paulo as Brazil’s military regime tightened its grip on power. Tropicália became a way for artists to expose the contradictions of modernisation under such an authoritarian rule. Additional archive courtesy of Adam Ritchie Photography.

The work’s title is an ever-increasing figure: the number of people who migrated from one country to another last year added to the number of migrant deaths recorded so far this year – to indicate the sheer scale of mass migration and the risks involved. Bruguera has brought together a group of 21 people who live or work in the same postcode as Tate Modern. Called Tate Neighbours, they will explore how the museum can learn from and adapt to its local community. They have decided to rename Tate Modern’s Boiler­ House for a year in honour of local activist Natalie Bell. The Tate Neighbours have also written a manifesto which appears when you sign in to the free WiFi. In the Turbine Hall is a large heat-sensitive floor. By using your body heat and working together with other visitors, you can reveal a hidden portrait of Yousef, a young man who left Syria to come to London. Meanwhile, a low-frequency sound fills the space with an unsettling energy. In a small room nearby, an organic compound in the air induces tears and provokes what the artist describes as ‘forced empathy’. Tania Bruguera engages with 'the role of emotions in politics'. Her main concerns are institutional power, borders and migration. Her work spans performance, events, action, film, installation, sculpture, writing and teaching alongside site-specific works. Often, she sets out to cause change through her work. She calls this approach 'Arte Útil' (useful art), in which people engage as users rather than spectators. #TaniaBruguera #TurbineHall Find out more about the commission: http://bit.ly/2OEzEky Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Tate,Tate Modern,Art,Modern Art,Contemporary Art,British Art,Tania Bruguera,Turbine Hall,Migration,South London,Hyundai Commission,migration crisis;27;Education;Society;PT5M52S;352;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7reNkai8H0I/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;33535;281;;0;6

Each element of The Squash has evolved from Hamilton's interest in a photograph she found in a book several years ago when looking at improvisational theatre and participatory art practices in the 1960s and 1970s. It showed a person dressed as what looks like a vegetable lying among vines. The original photograph dated from 1960 and depicted a scene from a dance by American choreographer Erick Hawkins. Hawkins was interested in Native American philosophies and he took the form of this costume from the Squash Kachina of the Hopi culture.

A painter and photographer who used feminist theory in her work, Hunter was politically active and deeply involved in the emerging British feminist scene. Hunter worked with photography and, creating sequences focused on feminist politics that inversed concepts of the ‘male gaze’. She used popular culture and advertising aesthetics to interrogate socio-political issues such as sexual violence and the construction of gender. Hunter often used her own hands in her images, referring to advertising techniques where a hand presents a desirable product.

Like most religious paintings, 'An Allegory of Man’ is packed with hidden meanings. Extremely few British paintings of religious subjects have survived from the 16th century. After the Reformation, Protestant unease about images meant it would have been highly controversial to display either religious paintings. The inscription at the bottom, in English, warns against the evil of worldly vanity. Instead it urges prayer to ensure the safe passage of the soul to heaven. The resurrected Christ appears at the top. Below him, at the centre, is Man, shielded by Christian and moral virtues against attacks from all sides by the Seven Deadly Sins.

In her paintings, Johnson addresses colonial history and its ongoing impact on Australia’s political and social reality. Born in 1979 in Melbourne, Australia, Johnson lives and works in Melbourne. Her work blends figuration and abstraction, by representing people, animals and objects from the past in full and in fragments or silhouettes. ‘Bad Debt’ 2016, for example, depicts layers of overlapping images, including a bedroom interior with a smashed window, non-indigenous animals, such as foxes and rabbits, and people dressed as a cat, a horse and a man. It portrays Australia as a country with an unstable and conflicted identity while also implying that representation is always partial and subjective. With the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA), Tate has acquired three paintings by Helen Johnson as part of their International Joint Acquisition Programme for contemporary Australian art, supported by Qantas. The programme promotes Australian art globally, helping Australian artists reach new audiences.;Tate,Tate Modern,Tate Britain,Tate Liverpool,Tate St Ives,Art,Modern Art,Contemporary Art,British Art,Helen Johnson,Humour,Artist,Australia,Melbourne,Australian artist,Australian art,political art,colonial history,colonialism,painting,painter,Museum of Contemporary Art Australia,Qantas;27;Education;Humour,Knowledge;PT5M28S;328;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5XvgXRnk_HM/maxresdefault.jpg;1;;;;13924;322;;0;13

In October 2018, a landmark research project commissioned by Arts Council England – and involving schools and teachers who work with either the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) or Tate – outlined the overwhelmingly positive benefits of arts and cultural education on the lives of young people. The research, 'Tracking Arts Learning and Engagement (TALE)', undertaken by the School of Education at the University of Nottingham, has led to calls for urgent change, as thousands of young people and teachers express concern over the impact that declining arts and cultural provision in schools will have on future generations. #TateShots Find out more: https://goo.gl/Zo5Ncv Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Tate,Tate Modern,Tate Britain,Art,Modern Art,Contemporary Art,British Art,David Hockney,Yinka Shonibare MBE,Michael Craig-Martin,Catherine Opie,Cate Blanchett,Anne-Marie Imafidon,Cornelia Parker,Wolfgang Tillmans,Amanda Levete,Tania Bruguera,Bob and Roberta Smith,Michael Clark,Jacqueline Wilson,Alan Parker,Jeremy Deller,Why Study Art?,curriculum,Tracking Arts Learning and Engagement (TALE),art and education,art education,education;27;Education;Knowledge;PT3M55S;235;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vKjkx6PzajE/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;397411;6217;;0;159

First created in 1984, ‘Room. 2’ was a result of her frustration from the oppressive Soviet Regime. The Soviet state only permitted artists working in the prominent ‘socialist realist style’ to practice making art. As an ‘unofficial’ artist, Irina used accessible materials to make art at home. Using black, white and grey paper, Irina's work confused visitors who stepped into the space. ‘Room. 2’ became a space for artistic debate for the tight-knit community of Moscow Conceptualist artists. Alongside her friends and colleagues Ilya Kabakov, George Kisevalter, Vladimir Sorokin, Dmitrii Prigov, and Andrei Monastyrsky, Irina Nakhova is considered one of the founding members of the 'Moscow Conceptualism' movement. #TateShots Find out more about Irina Nakhova: https://bit.ly/2vSKsov Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Tate,tateshots,tate modern,irina nakhova,moscow conceptualism,installation art,feminism,russia,societ union,ussr,unofficial artist,illusion,space,contemporary art,contemporary artist;27;Education;Hobby,Lifestyle_(sociology);PT6M17S;377;2d;hd;FALSE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Lkpa9hV1nU/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;20346;367;;0;6

Objectifying her body, the Mauritius born British artist has literally used her figure as a flower vase and photography camera. By placing a light sensitive paper in her mouth and using her lips as the aperture and shutter, Lindsay developed images in a black sack resulting in compelling circular images tinged red by her cheeks. Mute until the age of seven, Seers possessed an eidetic (photographic memory) that vanished when she began to speak. The artist naturally found comfort in recreating this lost ability through the lens of a camera. ‘Extramission 6 (Black Maria)’ is a video projection installation acquired by Tate. It is a seemingly autobiographical work about the artist in which her photographic memory leads her to become too consumed with the visual world and withdraws from family and society. The projection is screened within a reconstruction of the inventor Thomas Edison's famous 'Black Maria', purportedly the world's first movie studio. #TateShots Find out more about Lindsay Seers: https://bit.ly/2vyrkvJ Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Tate,tateshots,linsday seers,artist,photgraphy,puppet,camera,body,vase,flowers,extramission,black maria,video,installation,contemporary art,contemporary artist,artist interview,studio visit;27;Education;Knowledge;PT6M52S;412;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B0XqeAFS4Qk/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;40905;1286;;0;30

From Brillo boxes and black bean soup to portraits of films stars, Andy Warhol is famous for his bright and bold paintings and prints that celebrate 1960s popular culture. This style of art is called pop art. Printmaking appealed to Warhol as it allowed him to repeat a basic image and create endless variations of it by using different colours or sometimes adding paint to the printed surface. Isn't life a series of images that change as they repeat themselves? Andy Warhol In 1972, Warhol made a series of screenprints of Chairman Mao, the leader of communist China. Mao may seem an unlikely celebrity, but in the early 1970s America’s president, Richard Nixon, visited Beijing and Mao’s portrait was everywhere – making him something of a contemporary icon. Warhol used a photograph from the cover of the Little Red Book (a book of quotations by Chairman Mao) as the starting point for his portrait.

The materials used to create the painting are challenging for conservators, as they don't react well to traditional cleaning methods. Our conservation team have spent months trialling and evaluating different techniques for treating the work. At last, a ground-breaking gel treatment broadly based on nanotechnology has allowed us to clean the work in a safe and controlled way, for the very first time in the painting's history. The treatment has been made possible thanks to a new gel created by CSGI Florence.

Born in Russia in 1933 Erik Bulatov became a leading underground artist in 1960's Moscow. Not wanting to depend on state commissions, Erik used supplies from his day job, illustrating children's books, to create work that explored the difficulties and isolation of living under the Soviet regime. A response to 'today's political situation', Erik's work Forward (2016) went on display outside Tate Modern in 2017. Standing ten feet high, Erik created a painting 'which the viewer can enter'.

The brutal split that created India and Pakistan in 1947 is the starting point for Kanwar’s disturbing yet poetic multichannel video essay, combining memory, literature, and history to illuminate the often repressed and newly urgent subject of sexual violence against women on the Indian subcontinent. Rather than representing the women as victims, his work emphasises the possibility of resistance by exploring ways of going beyond suffering. By examining the resilience and dignity of those who suffer he creates a space of transformative contemplation of unspeakable horror.

Her work, often set in the Asia-Pacific, explores the relationship between technology and the environment and the complicity between global media and government. In 'Transit' 2011, Norrie shows the aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan and the tsunami which followed causing widespread flooding and the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. An anti-nuclear demonstration shows the anger and frustration of people following the disaster, while the destructive power of nature is emphasised by a shot of the Sakurajima volcano erupting prior to the earthquake. Collaborating with the scientists of the Japanese Aerospace Agency (JAXA), Norrie filmed rockets taking off from the island of Tanegashima carrying satellites to track weather patterns and global greenhouse emissions. On the island of Okinawa, Norrie filmed the night drill of the American airbase, which provides an ominous contrast to the predominant indigenous culture of the people living there. Throughout 'Transit', Norrie uses the voice of a shaman, Yoshimaru Higa, as a way of providing a new perspective on man’s relationship with nature.

Playtime (2014) follows six characters: the Artist, the Hedge Fund Manager, the Auctioneer, the House Worker, the Art Dealer, and the Reporter, exploring how each is affected by capital and the global financial crisis. The work also exists as a seven-screen installation.

In the 1960s, performance was seen as fundamentally different from the art that could be collected or shown by art museums. It was live and ephemeral, challenging traditional notions of art. But today performance has come to be seen as more a set of strategies available to contemporary artists, one that is not inherently different from other art forms and not at all beyond what a museum can and should show. Now an accepted part of the visual art world, the term has since been used to also describe film, video, photographic and installation-based artworks through which the actions of artists, performers or the audience are conveyed. Funded by The Arts and Humanities Research Council, this film reflects the ideas of the online publication 'Performance at Tate: Into the Space of Art' (Tate Research 2016): http://bit.ly/2lFsG5s 'Performance at Tate: Into the Space of Art' explores how concepts of art have changed in relation to recent shifts in artistic production and how artists have responded to the possibilities offered by museums. The project offers essays and case studies, and publishes audio, films and videos, photographs, museum documents and reviews drawn from Tate's Archive, showing the richness and depth of the gallery's engagement with performance over half a century. #TateShots Discover more about Performance Art: https://goo.gl/EaWiUi Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Tate,tate modern,art,An Introduction to Performance Art,An Introduction to Performance Art | TateShots,Performance Art,photograph,art museums,live,ephemeral,contemporary artists,contemporary art,The Arts and Humanities Research Council,Performance at Tate,Performance at Tate: Into the Space of Art,Performance,artworks,actions,spontaneous;27;Education;Knowledge,Performing_arts;PT3M42S;222;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6Z-YZ3A4mdk/maxresdefault.jpg;1;;;;380454;5240;;0;63

On moving to New York City in the late 1940s, Mekas founded Film Culture magazine with his brother Adolfas which published criticism and analysis of all aspects of experimental and mainstream Hollywood film. He also co-founded the Film-Makers’ Cooperative which eventually grew into the Anthology Film Archives – the world’s largest and most important repositories of avant-garde film. Diaries, Notes & Sketches a.k.a. Walden in the Tate collection is compiled from material shot on 16mm film between 1964 and 1968 and stands as one of the most epic portraits of the 60s New York art scene. Over the course three hours, Mekas invites the viewer into a circle of friends and colleagues including John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Allen Ginsberg, Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick, as well as contemporary experimental filmmakers Tony and Beverly Conrad, Michael Snow and Jack Smith.

To tie in with the 50th anniversary of the Beatles album Sgt.

The work is the artist’s largest painting to date. After studying painting and sculpture in the 1970s at the University of California, Los Angeles, Chicago was the first artist to launch a feminist art programme. Her goal has been to create a place for female-centred imagery and to overcome the erasure of women’s achievements in art and society. Chicago’s most influential work is the iconic installation The Dinner Party (1974–9), which today is a permanent exhibition at the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum.

This is the first time Jones has composed a piece of contemporary classical music, and he worked closely with collaborator Joseph Davies who also worked on the album 2013.

Based in Los Angeles since, he has become one of the most influential artists of his generation. Making his name as a pioneer of conceptual art in the 1960s with his text and image paintings, Baldessari shocked the art world when he announced in a newspaper that he was cremating all the artworks he had produced between 1953 and 1966. He then turned his attention to photographic works often incorporating found film stills, trawling dumpsters for discarded material from which he created his famous photo-compositions.

The back of the canvas of this Picasso painting is inscribed with the words ’Boisgeloup 27 Juillet 1932’ leaving some experts to question whether the painting was completed in a day. In Tate’s conservation lab the team examined the painting and made some interesting discoveries about Picasso’s technique and use of paint. This work itself belongs to the remarkable sequence of portraits that Picasso made of Marie-Thérèse Walter at his country property at Boisgeloup. Marie-Thérèse is presented here – as in most of her portraits – as a series of sensuous curves. Even the scrolling arms of the chair have been heightened and exaggerated to echo the rounded forms of her body. The face is a double or metamorphic image: the right side can also be seen as the face of a lover in profile, kissing her on the lips.

The college’s progressive principles were based on the educational theories of John Andrew Rice, its founder. In the curriculum, drama, music and fine art were given equal status to all other academic subjects. Teaching was informal, with an emphasis on collaboration, communal living and outdoor activities. Most of the work of running the college and maintaining the buildings was done by students and faculty. Black Mountain quickly became an extraordinary powerhouse of modern culture in America. Amongst its teachers were some of the greatest names of modern American culture, including the Bauhaus teacher Josef Albers, who had fled Nazi Germany after the closure of the Bauhaus that same year and became one of the first teachers at the college. Abstract expressionist painters Willem and Elaine de Kooning, artists Robert Rauschenberg and Anni Albers, composer John Cage and dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham were all also associated with the school at one time or another.

Konttinen works both as a photographer and a filmmaker. Her series Byker 1969–81 documents the streets, buildings and primarily the inhabitants of Byker, a working class community in the east side of Newcastle upon Tyne. The Byker series includes a range of portraits, from traditional studio-style images to photographs of groups gathered in moments of leisure. Until the 1960s it was a working class area of densely built Victorian terrace and slum housing, after which it was redeveloped by the local council, who had condemned the houses as unfit for human habitation. Demolition began in 1966 and the council appointed the architect Ralph Erskine to design its replacement: the now Grade II listed Byker Wall estate, which was constructed between 1969 and 1982. In 1969 Konttinen moved to Byker, where she lived for six years until her house was demolished. She returned over the next decade to continue to document life in the community.

Anywhen was a site-specific exhibition that changed throughout the day and that would evolve during the six-month period of the commission, until 2 April 2017. Visitors would have their senses activated and stimulated by a spectacular choreography of acoustics, sound lighting, flying objects and film, each connected to the other, and playing their part in a far bigger score. Tate’s Turbine Hall became a universe of inter-related and connected events and parallel realities. Events would unfold anywhen. Philippe Parreno is a French avant-garde artist who came to prominence in the 1990s and is perhaps most widely known for his feature film Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait. Parreno works across film, video, sound, sculpture, performance and information technology and collaborates extensively with musicians, scientists, architects and writers. Cutting-edge musicians Factory Floor and the award-winning sound designer Nicolas Becker are just some of the many collaborators involved in the commission.

Hendricks is an American painter and photographer best known for his realist and post-modern portraits of people living in urban areas, beginning in the 1960s and 70s and continuing to the present. Family Jules: NNN (No Naked Niggahs) (1974) – currently on display in Tate Modern – is one of four paintings that Hendricks made featuring a former student of his at Yale University, George Jules Taylor. In an apparently orientalising interior, he is shown on a luxurious white couch in complete confidence of his nakedness. By positioning a naked black male figure in the place of the traditional female ‘odalisque’, Hendricks adopted an extremely radical stance. As his challenging subtitle underlines, the painting confronts white fears and sexual stereotypes surrounding the black male. While many artists turned to African art to make idealised images of black subjects, he made more realistic images of everyday black figures. Furthermore, in Family Jules, Hendricks not only confronted tendencies to Africanise or idealise the black body, but also tackled the reluctance of black artists to represent naked subjects long associated with exploitative images.

The hair comes from local temples, where it is cut off as a sacrificial offering when pilgrims fulfil sacred vows. In today’s consumer driven world, the longer lengths are sold to make wigs or supply keratin for beauty products, while the shorter sections are kept to make protective talismans, such as those used by motorists.

The video is directed by acclaimed choreographer Holly Blakey (Florence & The Machine, Jessie Ware) and the song in the video is an original composition for the project created by Mabel specifically for this special collaboration. The video is reflective of Gustav Metzger’s Liquid Crystal Environment 1965, remade 2005 which is displayed within the new Tate Modern. The colourful, psychedelic patterns produced by light displays such as Metzger’s became icons of London’s cultural scene in the 1960s, as musicians in particular sought to create total sensory environments for the appreciation of their work.

At 27 she moved to New York City after marrying American art historian Robert Goldwater. She began her career with paintings and drawings in the 1940s and by the 1960s had begun to experiment with wood, plaster, latex and other solid materials to create bold and subversive sculptural forms. In this film her friend and assistant of over 30 years Jerry Gorovoy explains the childhood trauma and pain Bourgeois was communicating through her work.

The artist takes experiences, objects and events that relate to contemporary Iranian daily life, and explores how they relate to a larger social context. Ansarinia has said ‘my work is always focused on the environment that I live in, portraying very ordinary, everyday life and my position within that context... I’m a deconstructionist who reconstructs the torn apart elements that show something new about something so banal that has gone unnoticed. So repetitive that it becomes part of routine life.’ Artist Cities is a series co-produced with The Guardian, in which we explore the native or adopted cities of a range of major international artists.

From the mid-1960s Minujín became one of the most energetic contributors to the pop art scene in Buenos Aires. Throughout her practice Minujín explores the value of audience participation in the redefinition of art’s purpose. She was a student in the National University Art Institute in the 1950s and travelled to Paris and New York throughout the 1960s. In Paris she was part of group of artists who created large-scale happenings and ‘livable sculptures’ from found objects and materials. The works were always temporary and destroyed after they were presented. La Menesunda (1965) is a project she conceived in collaboration with Rubèn Santantonín and others associated with the Torcuato Di Tella Institute in Buenos Aires. One of the most celebrated works of the decade, La Menesunda is inspired by the city of Buenos Aires itself and consisted of multiple environments or areas which included a room with a couple in bed, a dental surgery, a walk-in freezer and a beauty salon housed in a structure in the shape of a woman’s head. La Menesunda sought to transform the passive spectator into an active participant. Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art collaborated with Minujín in recreating La Menesunda and it was open to the public from August 2015 to May 2016.

Female relationships, friendships and dialogues form the foundation of the artist’s varied subject matters. Her practice engages with many often-overlooked styles, techniques and formal concerns from the history of painting, such as her use of egg tempera. Working in a style that combines the graphic and the painterly, Kruglyanskaya embraces a wide range of influences from German expressionism to film and popular culture of the 1950s and 1960s.

Charting, mapping and surveying oceans, coasts, land and resources were essential tools of Empire. Part of a wider gathering of information by the West about the world, they defined sea and trade routes, and identified territory to be claimed and colonised. Following earlier Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch navigators, buccaneering Elizabethan mariners and the ‘discovery voyages’ of James Cook and Matthew Flinders accompanied by ‘scientific gentlemen’ laid the foundations of a British Empire focused on maritime trade and the exploitation of regional resources. Trading ‘factories’ and forts built by the East India Company grew into great cities, their surroundings and hinterland surveyed by military engineers. Maps were made for settlers, builders of roads and railways, defence and warfare. Using their own skills and technical inventiveness, British cartographers and surveyors also learned from colonial rivals and regional expertise. Their work sometimes involved collaboration, but was often suspect, resented or opposed.

She began her career in performance and has continued to create across many mediums, including producing apps. In this film July explains how live performance allowed her to ‘engage in the present moment’ and feel the immediacy of the audience ‘right here, right now’. Her work continues to challenge and engage the viewer by blurring the line between performance and film – most notably in 2011’s The Future which featured some key scenes originally conceived and staged in her performance work and began with the self-imposed question – how do you turn ‘a performance into a movie?’ Discover more about Performance Art: http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/p/performance-art Subscribe for weekly films about art: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=tate;2016,tate,tateshots,miranda july,art,performance,performance art;27;Education;Entertainment,Film;PT6M21S;381;2d;hd;FALSE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VWSmhafUprA/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;84677;1360;;0;19

His work examines the actuality and context of art within Western capitalism and the essential qualities of what it means to be human. Influenced by Marxist counter-cultural politics in the 1960s, Brisley adopted performance as the democratic basis for a new relationship between artist and audience. Brisley first achieved notoriety in the 1960s and 70s and is perhaps best known for his disturbing physical performances. He has challenged the human body in physical, psychological and emotional ways. Recent works include Brisley’s sober watercolour landscapes from the series Jerusalem, a reference to William Blake’s poem in which trees and foliage seem to sprout and grow from amidst the rubble.

The inspiration for the painting came during a boating expedition Sargent took on the Thames at Pangbourne in September 1885, with the American artist Edwin Austin Abbey, during which he saw Chinese lanterns hanging among trees and lilies. Sargent began the picture while staying at the home of the painter F.D. Millet at Broadway, Worcestershire, shortly after his move to Britain from Paris. At first he used the Millets's five-year-old daughter Katharine as his model, but she was soon replaced by Polly and Dorothy (Dolly) Barnard, the daughters of the illustrator Frederick Barnard, because they had the exact hair-colour Sargent was seeking. He worked on the picture, one of the few figure compositions he ever made out of doors in the Impressionist manner, from September to early November 1885, and again at the Millets's new home, Russell House, Broadway, during the summer of 1886, completing it some time in October. Sargent was able to work for only a few minutes each evening when the light was exactly right. He would place his easel and paints beforehand, and pose his models in anticipation of the few moments when he could paint the mauvish light of dusk. As autumn came and the flowers died, he was forced to replace the blossoms with artificial flowers. The picture was both acclaimed and decried at the 1887 Royal Academy exhibition. The title comes from the song 'The Wreath', by the eighteenth-century composer of operas Joseph Mazzinghi, which was popular in the 1880s. Sargent and his circle frequently sang around the piano at Broadway. The refrain of the song asks the question 'Have you seen my Flora pass this way?' to which the answer is 'Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose'.

In 1963 Brown and Calder embarked on a musical collaboration, for which Calder made Chef d’orchestre, where four percussionists are ‘conducted’ by the mobile. Some 100 percussion instruments are employed in a performance where the movement of the sculpture is read by the percussionists, responding to the varying configuration of its elements. As well as functioning as conductor, the musicians actually play the mobile, making each performance both visually and musically unique. It was not until 1966 that the work was finished and Calder Piece was first performed at the Théâtre de l’Atelier in Paris, early in 1967. Calder Piece is one of kind and Earle Brown insisted that the music must never be independent of Chef d’orchestre. This major revival of a work not played for over 30 years is its UK premiere, performed by the percussion ensemble of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in collaboration with Gramophone Award-winning conductor Richard Bernas.

Her precisely constructed works often take the form of audio recordings, performance and printed matter. DOUG is an operatic piece comprising of nine songs for six voices. Song titles include ‘Fall’ ‘Choke’ ‘Crash’ ‘Strike’ and ‘Sink’. Voice, rhythmic verse and the structures inherent in music are used to give shape to the disastrous events that befall him.

Previous works have included wood, plastics, human hair, glass, screws, plants, ceramic, bone, cement, feathers. Autoconstrucción loosely translated means ‘self-constructing’ and is a reference to the building methods used in his home town of Ajusco on the outskirts of Mexico City where he continues to live and work. In the 1960s many people moved from the countryside towards the city, forming their own communities and makeshift homes out of whatever materials they could afford and upon what was thought to be uninhabitable volcanic land. Cruzvillegas has created a new artwork for the Turbine Hall incorporating his signature principles of autoconstrucción. Empty Lot consists of discarded materials from various London construction-sites built into the structure of the installation. On the top platform of the piece triangular planters containing soil from parks and green spaces all over London lie in a graphic almost geometric pattern. The planters are lit by lamps and watered every day, creating the optimum environment for something to potentially grow.

His depictions of people and the urban landscapes near his London studio show him to be one of the greatest painters alive today. Here, photographer and Auerbach fan Mary McCartney describes her love of the artist’s work. For half a century the artist has lived and worked in the same part of London, in Camden Town, one of the major subjects of his work. Painting 365 days a year, he has continued discarding what he does, scraping back the surface of the canvas to start and re-start the painting process daily, continuing afresh for months or years until the single painting is realised in a matter of hours, having finally surprised him, seeming true and robust. Tate Britain’s exhibition, featuring paintings and drawings from the 1950s to the present day, offers fascinating new insights into his work, with the artist suggesting the selection of the first six galleries.

The story takes place in a bourgeois setting in which hallucinations, schizophrenia, alcoholism, madness and drug addiction turn into surrealist mayhem. Two professional actors play the role of the mother and the son, while Olowska’s friends and collaborators take on characters including the maid, the prostitute, the aristocratic party boy and the suspicious individual. Olowska transformed a room in the Poetry and Dream collection display into the theatre set which was open during the day as an installation. The room became a domestic interior inhabited by works by artists including Meredith Frampton, Dora Carrington and Henri Matisse and shows Olowska’s continued interest in the appropriation of histories and the function of painting as a fictional space. This performance took place at Tate Modern on Monday 21 September, Wednesday 23 September and Friday 25 September 2015 as part of the series BMW Tate Live 2015. – More info: http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/performance-and-music/paulina-olowska-mother-unsavoury-play-two-acts-and Subscribe for weekly films about art: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=tate;2015,Tate Modern London (Museum),Paulina Olowska,Mother,Bmw,art,Performance Art (Film Genre),Artist (Project Role);27;Education;Entertainment,Performing_arts;PT2M46S;166;2d;hd;FALSE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKDdq7dFmOc/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;3263;25;;0;0

Here, the artist talks about his 1975 work Disciples of Sheikh San'an – a woollen rug made with traditional techniques – and its related screenprints. Tanavoli’s practice, developed throughout the 1960s and 1970s, is characterised by the incorporation of traditional Persian techniques, notably everyday crafts found in the blacksmiths, foundries and workshops of Tehran, and traditional subjects such as popular love stories from Persian poetry. His series of screenprints celebrate Persian myths and symbols through a modernist visual language. Many of his works pay tribute to the legendary love story of Farhad, the only sculptor mentioned in classical Persian poetry, who challenged the Sassanian King Khosrow Parviz, his rival for the hand of the beloved princess Shirin. Tanavoli reinterprets, throughout his works, this poetic legend as well as icons found in Shiite folk art, such as the cage, the lion, the lock and the bird, using geometric forms and new mediums.

Since the mid-1960s her work has interrogated the female body as an instrument and object. Influenced by the socio-political upheavals and demonstrations of the 1960s, Red Coat, 1969, was designed for a concert of Brazilian musicians Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, which took place at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. Created for various improvised performances in public spaces, the Red Coat is exemplary of Nicola L’s experimentation with presenting the human body as a conceptual piece of art. The Red Coat strips the ‘body’ of any particular identity and immerses the wearers in a communal performance to declare the peaceful notion - ‘Same Skin for Everybody’. After working between Europe and the United States for nearly twelve years, in 1979 Nicola L moved definitively to live and work in New York City. Find out more about Nicola L: https://goo.gl/hZ3ttH The Red Coat was on display at Tate Modern as part of the The EY Exhibition: The World Goes Pop, 17 September 2015 – 24 January 2016.

The Tate acquired one edition of the work in 1981, placed it in storage and when it was requested for display in 1989 conservators discovered the material had disintegrated due to a moth-infestation.

The Gallery of Lost Art was an online exhibition that told the stories of vanished artworks. Whether destroyed, stolen, discarded or erased some of the most significant artworks of the last 100 years have been lost and can no longer be seen. When installed on the facade of the new British Medical Association headquarters in the Strand in London in 1908, Jacob Epstein’s eighteen nude statues were among the most hotly debated artworks in Britain. Although the details of the carvings forty feet high were not easily seen from ground level, the nudity of Epstein’s figures provoked immediate protests. In the end, however, it was not moral or aesthetic arguments that proved the undoing of Epstein’s carvings. Instead, thirty years of acid rain, caused by London’s smog, weakened the stones and in 1937 part of one sculpture became detached, falling into the street below. The sculptures were immediately checked and all protruding sections of the figures – including faces, shoulders and arms, and feet – were chiselled away, despite Epstein’s protests as what he saw as blatant vandalism and the revenge of traditionalists who disliked the sculptures.

Mary Kelly arrived in London as a student at a time when the public began to protest contentious political issues like gender equality and the Vietnam War. She became involved in the early women’s liberation movement throughout the 1970s and went on to lead the way for representations of women in the arts. Feminist theory, political discourse and education have remained a constant theme in her work throughout her career. Her work 'Post-Partum Document' 1973-79 draws on contemporary feminist thought and psychoanalysis to explore the roles of woman artists as both creative and procreative. More recently, Kelly has developed a process where she creates various sizes of prints cast from units of lint, the textile fibres that separate in a domestic dryer. Fashioned over several months and hundreds of washing cycles, the panels of image and text are then assembled and pressed in intaglio. Mary Kelly is Professor of Art at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she is Head of Interdisciplinary Studio.

Agnes Martin is recognised for her evocative paintings and restrained style, which was underpinned by her deep conviction in the emotive and expressive power of art. In 1967, just as her art was gaining acclaim, Martin abandoned the artistic community in New York City and went in search of solitude and silence. For almost two years she traveled across the US and Canada before finally settling in New Mexico. From there within tightly prescribed limits she imposed on her own practice Martin was able to continue to make extraordinary, visionary paintings, for over three decades until her death in 2004.

In this TateShots the artist reflects on his long and influential career. Themes of political activism and engagement are heavily rooted in his work. He arrived in Britain as a refugee after losing several members of his family in the Holocaust and was associated with protests against American rocket bases in the UK as well as campaigns for nuclear disarmament. He also went to prison for encouraging mass non-violent civil disobedience.

Bruguera was detained in Cuba for attempting to present this work in Havana’s Revolutionary Plaza. The recreation at Tate Modern featured members of the public alongside artists, writers and curators speaking for a minute on any subject of their choice. The work was restaged in an act of solidarity and support for Bruguera and artists all over the world persecuted for freedom of expression.

Head of Displays Matthew Gale explains how various departments across Tate collaborated to bring together this new presentation, from curators and art-handlers to conservation teams. The theme of ‘Making Traces’ explores making as gesture, the trace of an action, and includes artwork created as recently as 2014. At the centre of the display is the iconic ‘Rothko Room’ - which brings together Rothko’s nine Seagram murals for the first time in three years - giving visitors a chance to contemplate the variety of practices and forms presented in this expansive and exciting wing.

Leonora Carrington was one of the most prolific members of the Surrealist movement. After rejecting her upper-class upbringing in northern England, Carrington embarked upon a relationship with Surrealist artist Max Ernst, and became central in the Surrealist circles of France and New York. After hanging out with celebrated names such as Andre Breton and Pablo Picasso, the artist then moved to Mexico where she spend the rest of her life painting, as well as making sculpture, tapestry, writing poetry and designing for theatre and film.

Charlie Phillips was born in Jamaica and moved to London in the 1950s. He grew up in Notting Hill and is widely recognised as being the first photographer to document the Caribbean and West Indian immigrant communities that settled there in the 1960s. His work from this era is an important record of the overlooked black and working-class community, their day-to-day life and neighbourhood. In this episode of TateShots, Charlie, also known as ‘Smokey Joe’, returns to the streets of Notting Hill by way of Tate Britain’s 'Salt and Silver' photography exhibition, a new display which features salted paper prints, recognised as one of the earliest forms of photography. As Charlie reflects on the people and places he chronicled throughout his career, he finds much in common with Salt and Silver’s pioneering photographers and the work they created over 160 years ago.

In the summer of 1991, six months after the first Gulf War, Sophie Ristelhueber travelled to Kuwait and became obsessed by the traces the war left in the desert. In her artwork ‘Fait’ she documents ""the wounds that we inflict on earth"" through war. ‘Fait’, which means 'done' or 'fact' in French, purposefully confuses the viewer’s eye by obscuring the depth of field of each photograph. Even with all the technology we have now, when it comes to war ""in a way we see nothing"", says Ristelheuber. #TateShots Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl";TateShots,Tate Gallery Britain (Museum),Conflict Time,war photography,gulf war,Sophie Ristelhueber,Photography (Visual Art Form),photographer,Fait,Conflict,Time,Photography,Tate Modern,Kuwait,desert;27;Education;Knowledge;PT3M6S;186;2d;hd;TRUE;;en;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PBsgm4OBOfE/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;8105;99;;0;1

Nam June Paik was a visionary artist who foresaw the importance of mass media and new technology on the visual arts. 'He has really influenced not just the new generations of artists, but really popular culture', says his nephew Ken Hakuta. 'He’s not just global as an artist, but he foresaw the globalisation of everything – art, commerce, travel – everything.' 'He was one of the most innovative artists of the twentieth century, continues curator Sook-Kyung Lee. 'He was really quite a visionary, using ideas like Electronic Superhighway and technologies such as television set, laser, CCTV systems.' Hakuta recalls Nam June Paik as a great uncle because 'he wanted me to watch more TV. And I used to be a really bad piano student who had to take piano lessons. He took our family piano and destroyed it on stage, so no more piano lessons.' Paik also left some lasting advice: 'My uncle told me, you should experience everything once, and I think he gave my mind great flexibility in thinking of everything backwards and forwards, sideways. And maybe that’s why I’m not shocked by many things in life, because I may have learnt that from my uncle.' #TateShots Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Tate,Tate Modern,Modern Art,Contemporary Art,Nam June Paik,My Crazy Uncle,TateShots,Ken Hakuta,Inventor,art,music,visionary artist,visionary,mass media,new technology,visual arts,artists,popular culture,globalisation,commerce,travel,innovative,innovative artists,Sook-Kyung Lee,Electronic Superhighway,television,laser,CCTV,TV,piano;1;Film & Animation;Music;PT3M9S;189;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5RE1ueYnSVc/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;91865;953;;0;17

Considering Hadid’s concept of architecture and its relationship to space and the city, this conversation reflects on Malevich’s Architektons, as well as other works of Suprematism, as formative inspiration for her own practice. The volumetric compositions of Suprematism such as Architektons were utilised to create new possibilities for interior space, while Malevich experimented with these constructions as means for social transformation through radical architectural form. The novelty, purity and originality of these works fostered a new psychology of perception in both art and architecture. The link between Zaha Hadid and Suprematism has spanned her entire career, beginning with her 1976-77 graduation thesis for the Architectural Association, Malevich’s Tecktonik, which takes a visually deconstructed influence from Malevich and uses it as the starting point for a fourteen-level London hotel concept design. Following this interest, in 1993 Zaha Hadid was asked by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York to create an exhibition design for their encyclopaedic show of the Russian Avant-Garde, The Great Utopia. Hadid continues to demonstrate her relationship to Suprematism, recently designing and curating an exhibition at Galerie Gmurzynska Zurich that juxtaposed her own work with early twentieth-century Russian art pieces.

What myths are they rejecting and propagating? What is the social role of artists in different countries around the world today? How do artists negotiate power? Self-belief? Recognition? Author Sarah Thornton and artist Grayson Perry discuss how artists self-define and play the art-world game with particular attention to politics, kinship and craft, the three themes that structure Thornton’s forthcoming book, 33 Artists in 3 Acts. Thornton gained unprecedented access to major international artists, such as Ai Weiwei, Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman, Marina Abramović, Francis Alÿs, Gabriel Orozco, Andrea Fraser, Christian Marclay and Isaac Julien to Damien Hirst and Grayson Perry himself. During the course of her five years of research, she investigated issues of credibility and self-belief, exploring the relationship between the artists’ everyday lives and art practices. Challenging preconceptions and unpicking the complex layers that form his identity, Perry offers insight into the influences and networks that feed into the development and production of his work.

Alexandra Bachzetsis lives and works in Basel and Zurich. She is an artist and choreographer whose practice spans performance, theatre, dance and visual arts. In particular her work creates an inquiry into the similar influence between gesture and movement in ‘low’ genres such as romantic comedy or hip-hop music videos and in high art forms such as ballet and performance. Her performances also question stereotypical representations of the female body in contemporary popular culture. Typical gendered clichés become tools of self-reflection and empowerment.

Legendary Queen guitarist Brian May explains his obsession with Victorian stereoscopic photographs. Nineteenth-century photographic pioneers found they could take advantage of the human brain's capacity to create the illusion of depth from two flat images, and exploited it to the full. Queen guitarist Brian May has been collecting these striking images for over 40 years and now, for the first time, brings part of his collection together with some of the paintings that inspired them. A book of the photographs accompanies the display.

For this work, Campbell took inspiration from the 1953 visual essay Les Statues Meruent Assui (Statues Also Die) by Chris Marker and Alain Resnais about traditional West African art and colonialism’s effect on how we perceive culture. Nominated for his contribution to Scotland’s pavilion at the Venice Biennale, Campbell’s film comprises of four chapters - one features a performance by the Michael Clark Company and another images related to the Official IRA volunteer Joseph McCann.

'Piet Mondrian is one of the most important artists of the twentieth century,' says curator Michael White. 'He developed the language of abstract painting as we know it today. It didn’t really exist before his practice.' 'Most people thought this was of the end of painting', says White.' We think about these paintings now as the beginning.' 'It’s a really interesting question he’s posing himself', White continues. 'Can you use colour just as itself and not to stand for anything else? If you made yellow into a circle immediately people start making associations with the sun or something like that.' For the 70th anniversay of the artist's death, Tate Liverpool staged an exhibition Mondrian and his Studios, including an immersive life-size reconstruction of his Paris studio. 'A lot of people think about Mondrian’s paintings as just flat and graphic. However, here you start to see them as creating very dynamic spatial relationships. He’s thinking about his studio as a type of abstract space that he might be creating through painting.'

She also touches on how an artist can never see their own work as as the viewer does, as one can never ‘discover’ one’s own work.;tate,tateshots,art,artist,gallery,sculpture,rothschild,eva,perspex,riches,interview,studio,metal,fibre glass,documentary,Eva Rothschild (Author),Tourist Destination;1;Film & Animation;Hobby,Lifestyle_(sociology);PT3M2S;182;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDgRcP-mV5k/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;42086;278;;0;14

But what were Malevich's motivations and where did this iconic painting take him after 1915? Malevich's literally iconic Black Square may take centre stage in art history books as a turning point in modern art, but this exhibition shows another side to the father of abstraction, with his suprising and progressive return to figuration in his later career. From how they have evoked the display of the ground-breaking 1915 exhibition 0.10, to unpicking Malevich's later workers' portraits, Achim Borchardt-Hume, curator of the major Malevich retrospective at Tate Modern, takes us through the exhbition and introduces the key themes.

Artist Caragh Thuring talks about her new paintings and the representation of space in two dimensions. Focusing on architectural elements or landmarks, Thuring's paintings begin with extensive visual research - research which leads straight to paintings directly on to unprimed linen canvas. In this film she discusses where her inspiration comes from, how she knows when a painting is finished, and the 'act of generosity' it takes for a viewer to spend time with a painting. #TateShots Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;tate,tateshots,caragh,thuring,art,artist,paint,painter,painting,interview,film,artwork,gallery,exhibition,modern,Caragh Thuring;27;Education;Knowledge;PT3M36S;216;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tDHIV7-tamI/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;18894;199;;0;5

468;Tate;TuD4JVFXXq8;2014-06-27T17:27:46Z;2014-06-27 17:27:46;Bill Viola | TateShots;A special display of Bill Viola's Tiny Deaths 1993 at Tate Modern coincides with the installation of a new work by the artist in St Paul's Cathedral entitled Martyrs (Earth, Air, Fire, Water). Bill Viola and curator Matthew Gale talk us through the genus of the project and how the artist took on the challenge of creating the first moving-image artwork to be installed in a British cathedral or church on a long-term basis. Martyrs, a work by Bill Viola and Kira Perov, features four individuals, across four vertical screens, being martyred by the four classical elements Earth, Wind, Fire and Water. Flames rain down, water cascades, winds rage, and earth flies up. However, each martyr's resolve remains unchanged during the darkest hour of the martyr's passage through death into the light. Tiny Deaths was made in 1993. Barely visible figures are perceived in the darkened space until crescendos of light and sound bring moments of drama. The three projections envelop the viewer in the intense experience of the appearance and sudden disappearance of these presences. Martyrs (Earth, Air, Fire, Water) by Bill Viola is now on permanent display at St Paul's Cathedral and will be accompanied by a second piece entitled Mary from 2015.

Playing on the format of a museum audio tour, The Darks invites visitors to navigate the area around Tate Britain, where the Millbank Prison once stood. The original plan for Millbank Prison, which opened in 1816, was for a Panopticon. The design for the building, conceived by Jeremy Bentham in the late 18th century, would allow a single watchman to observe all inmates of an institution. The Panopticon has long been a byword for absolute power, discipline and control. The Darks audio tour, created by Ruth Ewan and Astrid Johnston, touches on the utopian dream at its heart, and how this optimism switched into the hellish reality of what followed. http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/darks-ruth-ewan-and-astrid-johnston;tate,tateshots,astrid,ewan,darks,millbank,prison,london,thames,art,artist,audio,talks,talk,dialogue,guide,history;1;Film & Animation;Knowledge;PT5M2S;302;2d;hd;FALSE;;;;;;;;4484;29;;0;1

As part of the four day-programme Spatial Confessions (On the question of instituting the public), Bojana Cvejić, Christine De Smedt, Marta Popivoda and Ana Vujanović address the question of publicness through a series of experiments staged within the Performance Room. Working together with members of the public, the performance presents a close-up view of social choreography in an enclosed room. The emphasis is on reflecting upon the living conditions of the participants, who are invited because their current living space is smaller or equal to the size of the Performance Room - 9.5m x 5.5m.

Mark Rothko's 'Black on Maroon' 1958 goes back on public view at Tate Modern on 13 May 2014, following 18 months of intensive work by the Conservation team and colleagues across Tate. The painting, one of the iconic Seagram murals which Rothko donated to Tate in 1970, was vandalised with graffiti ink in October 2012. It has since been the subject of detailed research and restoration by the core treatment team of Rachel Barker, Bronwyn Ormsby and Patricia Smithen. Over nine months the team researched methods for removing the ink from the delicate paint layers, using special test canvases to assess the appropriate solvents and cleaning methods. Rachel then spent a further nine months working on Black on Maroon itself, removing the majority of the surface ink before restoring the painting's surface.

Since the 1960s Carl Andre has made work that emphasises the inherent qualities of his materials. After a period carving sculpture, he began arranging everyday materials in simple geometric configurations. Andre has described his method as scavenging for 'physical realities' and he has often sought inspiration in the city streets.

Born in Latvia in 1938, Vija Celmins is best known for her intricate, monochromatic drawings of a select range of subjects; meticulous renderings of the surface of the ocean, the vastness of the night sky or the microscopic detail of a spider's web. In 1966 she began to use photographs as the subjects for her works, creating what she described as 'impossible images', reminding us of the complexity of the simplest things. With her slow, painstaking approach, some of these works take years to complete.

Her sculptures often bring together two separate elements establishing close relationships between contrasting materials, textures and colours, while exploring the polarities between light and shadow, revelation and concealment. Wilding is keen to stress that with sculpture, you don't immediately 'get the whole thing'; as a viewer, you need to walk around a piece and put work into looking at it it as a form in order to fully appreciate it. #TateShots Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl";Alison Wilding,Tate,TateShots,Documentary (TV Genre),Sculpture (Visual Art Form),Artist (Job Title),Art (Collection Category),Duveens,Tate Gallery Britain (Museum),Exhibition,Interview (Film),Studio (Art Subject),Studio visit,Harbour,Locust,Assemble,Found material,Nick Aldridge,Matt Wicks,Lara Garcia-Reyne;27;Education;Hobby,Lifestyle_(sociology);PT3M58S;238;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NvY8jXI5oS0/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;36831;260;;0;12

For the final Performance Room event of 2013 Daniel Linehan presents a new performance, untitled duet. Linehan and another dancer, Anneleen Keppens read from a prepared script whilst performing hundreds of meticulously designed movements. The dance accentuates all of the strange rhythms hiding within everyday speech: the hesitancies, interruptions, and stutters. Its aim, as in any good conversation, is to generate a continual emergence of difference. Performance Room is a series of performances commissioned and conceived exclusively for the online space. Performances are streamed live from the Performance Room at Tate Modern and then made available to watch online after the event.

Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members. Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs. Adrian Shaw is part of Tate’s Learning department, working on the Young People’s Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990’s and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago. Now established as ‘Late at Tate’, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art. Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw. Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians. He is currently making an album uniting English folk music with vintage analogue synthesizers. Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer, who’s distinctive bright, surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie, Tame Impala, Grimes, Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work “explores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.” This is an archived version of the 'Music meets Art' Hangout On Air that took place on 9 December 2013 at Tate Britain: http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/special-event/music-meets-art-hangout-on-air;tate,art,artist,music,performance,haroon,mirza,gallery,tate britain,google,meet new tate britain,britain,british,uk,london,millbank,painting,everything everything,storm thorgeson,live,streaming,hangout,hangout on air,musician,band,sound,audio,visual;1;Film & Animation;Music;PT35M5S;2105;2d;hd;FALSE;;;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pP0Rlw8mo8g/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;4940;41;;0;3

Painted at the height of the First World War, Gertler's painting shows rigid figures, seemingly trapped on an endlessly-revolving carousel.  Gertler lived near London's Hampstead Heath, and the image may relate to an annual fair held there for wounded soldiers.  Aldridge's prints pick up the scorching colours and dream-like quality of the original painting, whilst injecting a languorous sexuality to the scene.

For Ragnar Kjartansson’s Variation on Meat Joy the Performance Room at Tate has been transformed into a Rococo dining room. This online performance draws upon Carolee Schneemann’s iconic Meat Joy, 1964.

This draws the audience’s attention to the uncomfortably animalistic nature of the everyday act of eating.

Smith feels the contrast between where she comes from and where she lives now permeates throughout her work, with each piece an exploration of both the occidental and her current surroundings. A demonstration of this can be found in her collaboration with filmmaker Rafael Ortega, Xilitla. The work is named after a small town in Mexico which is the location of a garden created by the eccentric British aristocrat Edward James, an important collector of surrealist art.

Deprived of paper, El-Salahi would sketch out plans for future paintings on the back of small cement casings, before burying them in the sand whenever a guard would come near. Working in this manner led to the artist developing a new style, one seen in 'The Inevitable', where a painting spreads out from what he refers to as the 'nucleus', or the germ of an idea, with a meaning hidden even from the artist himself until the work is finished. Only when he saw 'The Inevitable' completed did El-Salahi realise how clear the message was; that people must rise up and fight tyranny and those that suppress them. This was something he felt was relevant not just to his own life when he created the work in the mid-eighties, but to all of Sudan.";Ibrahim El-Salahi,tate,Tate Modern London (Museum),modern,london,gallery,tateshots,art,artist,drawing,illustration,painting,Paint,Draw,Drawings,exhibition,inevitable,sudan,sudanese,Sudan (Country),Africa,Paintings,tyranny,imprisoned,false,prison,Exhibition,Retrospective,Oxford (City/Town/Village),Studio,Elvira,Museum (Building Function),Masterpiece (Literature Subject),Fine Art (Literary Genre);1;Film & Animation;;PT3M54S;234;2d;hd;FALSE;;;;;;;;32546;476;;0;15

Richard Tuttle came to prominence in the 1960s as part of a generation of Post-Minimalist artists, including Bruce Nauman and Eve Hesse, who questioned dominant trends of Minimalism by embracing an improvisational approach to art-making using everyday, often ephemeral materials.

It includes its own shop, library and restaurant as well as less conventional museum spaces such as a Salon, Music Room and Art and Religion Room - where you can sit down to relax, play the piano or have your tarot cards read. Gaba began working on the Museum of Contemporary African Art in 1997 during a residency in Amsterdam because he felt there was no space in Europe or Africa for the type of work he wished to make. As the work developed over several years and at various locations, Gaba also incorporated expressions of his own biography, including a Marriage Room containing photos, gifts and his wife's wedding dress from their marriage ceremony, which was conducted inside the museum. The Library also contains an audio work in which the artist imagines what his late father might say about his son's life. The 'Museum of Contemporary African Art' is 'not a model...it's only a question', says Gaba. As much a conceptual space as a physical one, it stands as a provocation to the Western art establishment to attend to contemporary African art.;Art (Collection Category),Museum (Building Function),Africa,Meschac Gaba,Fine Art (Literary Genre),Drawing,Painting,Artist,Drawings,Sculpture,Tate,Tate Modern,Benin,Nigeria,Yoruba,Ctonou,Cotonou,Ganvie,Port Novo,Interview,Documentary,Short film,Art,TateShots,Nick Aldridge,Nikky French,MAVA,Voodoo,Voodun,Ready-made,Furniture,Coffin,Reading Room,Marriage Room,Game Room,Chess,Masonic,Animisti,Animist,Christianity,Bibliotheque,Gaba,Kerryn Greenberg;1;Film & Animation;Hobby,Lifestyle_(sociology);PT4M44S;284;2d;hd;FALSE;;;;;;;;8469;86;;0;7

Lowry | TateShots;'Lowry is Britain's preeminent painter of the industrial city' says Tate curator Helen Little, as she introduces the exhibition 'Lowry and the Painting of Modern Life'. For Lowry, modern painting needed to represent the remaining rituals of public life: football matches and protest marches, evictions and fist-fights, workers going to and from the mill. Without his pictures, Britain would arguably lack an account in paint of the experiences of the 20th-century working class. As a modern painter Lowry wished to show what the industrial revolution had made of the world, yet his dominant status in British art coincided with a disappearance of the industrialised world he engaged with.

He has continued to draw on this background, producing works that demonstrate an ongoing interest in typography, signage and the West Coast of the United States. His creates paintings in which text is superimposed over landscapes and traditional American vistas, where the bold lettering is in complete opposition to the idyllic, idealised and somewhat kitsch representations of the images. Through this playful and characteristically enigmatic conflation of image and text, Ruscha explores the viewer's interpretation of language and transforms the words into subjects in themselves.

A rare female voice in the Beirut art scene from the 1940s onwards, she has spent her career combining western abstraction with the traditions of Islamic design. But, working through civil war and ongoing unrest in Lebanon, she remains virtually unknown outside her own country. This pioneer is belatedly recognised with her first major museum show. As her interlocking sculptures, textiles and paintings, both abstract and figurative, go on display at Tate Modern, we travel to Beirut to meet the artist's daughter at the apartment where Choucair's work started its journey.

He is often seen as a 19th-century Symbolist painter but this exhibition shows how he engaged with modernity and was inspired by the everyday life outside of his studio such as street scenes and incidents reported in the media. He was also influenced by the technological developments in cinema and photography at the time, referenced by his use of prominent foregrounds and strong diagonals. This technique creates the illusion of figures walking towards the viewer, a trick seen in many of Munch's most innovative work. Underpinning Munch's work is his preoccupation with psychological themes, exploring states of anxiety, isolation and fear -- states which, as this exhibition shows, Munch continued to explore right up to the end of his life.;tate,tate modern,edvard munch,walkthrough,tateshots;1;Film & Animation;Knowledge;PT4M16S;256;2d;hd;FALSE;;;;;;;;90177;1303;;0;28

He talked to TateShots. US photographer Lewis Baltz came to prominence in the 1970s as a leading figure in the New Topographic movement. The movement sprang from a seminal exhibition, including work by Baltz, of American landscape photography. Baltz epitomised this new movement through his sparse landscapes, finding a minimalist beauty in the factories, low-slung offices and parking lots of post-industrialised America. These everyday American landscapes are strikingly close to the abstract and stark forms of the minimalist art of the same period, and in a new display at Tate Modern, Baltz's photographs are shown alongside two floor sculptures by sculptor Carl Andre.

Describing it as an ' impossible, uncivilised place', Katz tells TateShots how the city changed completely after the emergence of Jackson Pollock, and how this in turn led Katz to pursue what he calls 'the immediate present' in his work. The artist's exhibition at Tate St Ives brought together over 30 canvases, plus collages and cut-outs, spanning the full breadth of his career from the 1950s to now. Given the Gallery's location on the beach, the exhibition placed a special emphasis on Katz's seascapes, as well as images of family holidays and friends, painted in his own seaside retreat of Lincolnville, Maine, where he continues to spend his summers.;tateshots,alex katz,tate st ives,Give Me Tomorrow,Alex Katz – 'I'm After the Immediate Present' | TateShots,New York studio,New York;1;Film & Animation;Hobby,Lifestyle_(sociology);PT4M40S;280;2d;hd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yHFLJ1qrVAA/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;104315;886;;0;44

'I realised that one of the main ingredients in making paintings was colour and geometry', says the artist. Born in Guyana (then British Guiana) in 1934, at 19 years old Frank Bowling moved to London. He went on to study painting at the Royal College of Art alongside David Hockney and R.B. Kitaj. As Bowling reflects on his long career, he remarks that his shift from figuration to abstraction came when he moved from London to New York. 'As I became more involved in the making of paintings, I realised that one of the main ingredients in making paintings was colour and geometry. And in New York I found ways of proceeding to deepen my investigations in that area', says the artist. 'New York was very much the place where it was all happening.' After moving to New York, the artist began working on a series paintings where poured paint directly onto canvas. 'It was spilling, dripping, rushing', says Bowling. 'It’s a process of a ground all over, the canvas tacked to the wall, the pouring and throwing and spilling and dripping takes place, then the material is allowed to settle, and once it starts drying you sort of pull it back up the wall, so that it can be completely dried out.' 'It all happens very much in an extempore way. I don’t have any pre-planned idea about how I’m going to make a painting.'

Damien Hirst first came to public attention in London in 1988 when he conceived and curated Freeze, an exhibition in a disused warehouse which showed his work and that of his friends and fellow students at Goldsmiths College. In the nearly quarter of a century since that pivotal show, Hirst has become one of the most influential artists of his generation. This is the first substantial survey of his work in a British institution and brings together key works from over twenty years. The exhibition includes iconic sculptures from his Natural History series, including 'The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living' 1991, in which he suspended a shark in formaldehyde. Also included are vitrines such as 'A Thousand Years' from 1990, medicine cabinets, pill cabinets and instrument cabinets in addition to seminal paintings made throughout his career using butterflies and flies as well as spots and spins. The two-part installation 'In and Out of Love', not shown in its entirety since its creation in 1991 and 'Pharmacy' 1992 are among the highlights of the exhibition. Tate Modern presented the first major Damien Hirst exhibition in the UK, which ran from 4 April - 9 September 2012.

Jérôme Bel (b 1964, France) is a French dancer and choreographer whom is best known for his characteristic style of non-dance. This interdisciplinary choreography rejects traditional dance, instead integrating aspects of other performance arts such as theatre or video. Bel’s work often challenges performance conventions and draws upon themes of minimalism. Bel’s work has been exhibited widely, including at Tate Modern, the Hayward Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art.;performance,bmw tate live,tate modern,jerome bell,shirtology;27;Education;Entertainment,Performing_arts;PT47M23S;2843;2d;hd;FALSE;;;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l0TmUQmKpDg/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;14352;86;;0;1

Well-known for her repeating dot patterns, her art encompasses an astonishing variety of media, including painting, drawing, sculpture, film, performance and immersive installation. It ranges from works on paper featuring intense semi-abstract imagery, to soft sculpture known as ‘Accumulations’, to her ‘Infinity Net’ paintings, made up of carefully repeated arcs of paint built up into large patterns. Since 1977 Kusama has lived voluntarily in a psychiatric institution, and much of her work has been marked with obsessiveness and a desire to escape from psychological trauma. In an attempt to share her experiences, she creates installations that immerse the viewer in her obsessive vision of endless dots and nets or infinitely mirrored space. At the centre of the art world in the 1960s, she came into contact with artists including Donald Judd, Andy Warhol, Joseph Cornell and Claes Oldenburg, influencing many along the way. She has traded on her identity as an ‘outsider’ in many contexts – as a female artist in a male-dominated society, as a Japanese person in the Western art world, and as a victim of her own neurotic and obsessional symptoms. After achieving fame and notoriety with groundbreaking art happenings and events, she returned to her country of birth and is now Japan’s most prominent contemporary artist.

His paintings are born out of a distrust of imagery in an image saturated world, and a belief that representation can only ever be partial and subjective. Drawing on images from film, television and photography, on subjects ranging from major historical events, such as the Holocaust, or the politics of the Belgian Congo, to something as inconsequential and banal as wallpaper patterns, he creates paintings that explore the inadequacy of collective memory.

TateShots visited him at his studio in southwest Scotland and took a walk with him through the landscape that is at the heart of his work. Land art is art that is made directly in the landscape, sculpting the land itself into earthworks or making structures in the landscape using natural materials such as rocks or twigs. Land art is usually documented in artworks using photographs and maps which the artist could exhibit in a gallery. Land artists also made land art in the gallery by bringing in material from the landscape and using it to create installations.

757;Tate;lefvPUYGvi0;2011-10-12T00:34:50Z;2011-10-12 00:34:50;Tacita Dean – FILM | Tate;Tacita Dean is the latest artist to take up the challenge of filling Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. Her response, entitled 'FILM', is a silent 35mm looped film projected onto a monolith standing 13 metres tall. FILM is an 11-minute silent 35 mm film projected onto a gigantic white monolith standing 13 metres tall at the end of a darkened Turbine Hall. It is the first work in The Unilever Series devoted to the moving image, and celebrates the masterful techniques of analogue filmmaking as opposed to digital. The work evokes the monumental mysterious black monolith from the classic science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film feels like a surreal visual poem, including images from the natural world among others, with the epic wall of the Turbine Hall showing through, in a montage of black and white, colour, and hand-tinted film. Tacita Dean is a British artist now based in Berlin, best known for her use of film. Dean’s films act as portraits or depictions rather than conventional cinematic storytelling, capturing fleeting natural light or subtle shifts in movement. Her static camera positions and long takes allow events to unfold unhurriedly. Other works have attempted to reconstruct events from memory, such as an infamous thwarted attempt to circumnavigate the world. Dean’s interest in the cinematic also extends to her work in other media. The Russian Ending 2001 borrows its title from the early Danish cinema tradition of making two alternate endings for a film: one happy for the American market and one tragic for the Russian market. In this work, Dean annotated postcards of catastrophes with director’s notes. Many of Dean’s works show the ways in which architecture can be transformed by the camera’s lens. Craneway Event 2009 follows the choreographer Merce Cunningham (1919–2009) and his dance company rehearsing in a former Ford assembly plant, built of glass and steel and overlooking the San Francisco Bay. Dean’s film allows the ever-changing light of this environment to fall in rhythm with the dancers’ movements.;[cat:artist interviews],[publish:youtube],tacita dean,[date:11.10.11],[cat:exhibitions],turbine hall,2011,unilever commissions,Film,tate modern,[channel:active];27;Education;Entertainment,Film;PT11M1S;661;2d;hd;FALSE;;;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lefvPUYGvi0/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;114208;1129;;0;17

One set documents the relatives of an Iraqi man who was a body double for Saddam Hussein's son; another show members of a religious sect in Lebanon who believe in reincarnation; while the exhibition title comes from a work about a living Indian man who was declared dead in official records. From feuding families in Brazil to victims of genocide in Bosnia, Simon forms a collection that maps the relationships between chance, blood and other components of fate. #TateShots Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl";Art,2011,taryn simon.

In 'Seedbed' Acconci positioned himself in the confined space under a specially constructed ramp and repeatedly masturbated, using the sound of visitors walking above him to fuel his sexual fantasies. 'Transference Zone' took place in a small room containing photographs of seven people who had an important place in the artist's life, along with some of their possessions. If a visitor knocked on the door, he would invite them in and respond to them as if he or she were that person. For 'Supply Room', Acconci stood blindfolded in a corner screened off by netting, while his companion Kathy Dillon sat in the opposite corner. Her voice was audible on a pre-recorded monologue, inviting women entering the space to kidnap Acconci and take him prisoner. The three performances reflect Acconci's interest in the interplay between the psychological and the social, and the overlapping boundaries of interior and exterior. They are seen as among the most important live artworks of the decade. Vito Acconci was born in the Bronx, New York in 1940. He lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.

During that time, he carried out research into the local economy and the materials associated with it. These investigations dovetailed with a longer-standing interest in the improvisatory architecture of his parents' house in Mexico City.

However realistic they may seem, these life-sized sunflower seed husks are in fact intricately hand-crafted in porcelain. Each seed has been individually sculpted and painted by specialists working in small-scale workshops in the Chinese city of Jingdezhen. Far from being industrially produced, they are the effort of hundreds of skilled hands. Poured into the interior of the Turbine Hall’s vast industrial space, the 100 million seeds form a seemingly infinite landscape. Porcelain is almost synonymous with China and, to make this work, Ai Weiwei has manipulated traditional methods of crafting what has historically been one of China’s most prized exports. Sunflower Seeds invites us to look more closely at the ‘Made in China’ phenomenon and the geo-politics of cultural and economic exchange today.

In this film Karlsson tells us how his drawings update this portrait of the city and its inhabitants.

It's been in decline ever since... TateShots boarded a train to Newcastle and filmed editors Simon Thorp, Graham Dury and Davey Jones as they finished off some specially made strips for Tate Britain's exhibition. Featuring Viz stalwarts the Fat Slags (""nice big curves""), Mrs Brady Old Lady (""she's obsessed with her bowels""), and new characters Thomas Rowlandson and James Gillray (""trying to impress a girl""), the cartoons are as childish and crude as they are pointless and purile. The Viz team also discuss what makes the magazine so British, why they gave up trying to be topical, and how ""nothing comes out of the comic looking good, least of all ourselves"".

Born Steven Hamper, he got the name Billy Childish from a mate when he played in a punk band as a teenager. Since then Childish been as prolific a painter as he is a musician, and in this interview he talks about how his approach to making music art and poetry is often the same: ""I'm interested in the elemental, not impressing myself and not impressing others.

Cosey is the ideal artist to start our new series on art and music - Sound & Vision - having worked across the two mediums since 1969. The artist also discusses her work from the 1970s, in which she modeled for glamour magazines as a way to explore the commodification of sex. It would have been hypocritical, she explains, to use images of other people when she could have done it herself. Moving seamlessly between the sex, art and music industries, Cosey puts herself at the heart of her artistic output. #TateShots Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;art,music,sound,vision,tate,modern,tateshots,band,live,Cosey Fanni Tutti (Composer),Throbbing Gristle,Chris and Cosey,Cosey Fanni Tutti,interview,contemporary art;27;Education;Music,Rock_music;PT6M28S;388;2d;sd;FALSE;;;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/npGAxnpBvAk/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;33809;331;;0;12

'History in the Making or the Secret Diaries of Linda Schultz' is a new live theatre piece by Israeli artist Keren Cytter, created in collaboration with D.I.E. Now (Dance International Europe), a theatre group recently formed by Cytter. John Webber, a political activist, and Linda Schultz, a graphic designer, awake one morning to discover they have each been subject to an unexpected and radical sex change. The repercussions of this event have a domino effect on society, sexual politics, and personal identity, ultimately leading to revolution, as Cytter playfully tells the story via film, language, imagery, choreography, performance and light projections. History in the Making takes inspiration from a diverse range of influences, including Pina Bausch, Bat-Sheva dance group, Samuel Beckett, 'Disney on Ice', Michael Jackson, Yvonne Rainer, and the exotic rhythms of the 1980s dance-floor filler the Lambada, creating a highly stylized theatrical performance, addressing the ideas with insight and humour. #TateShots Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;tate,modern,dance,performance,live,art,keren,cytter,gender,Keren Cytter,contemporary art,tate modern;27;Education;Entertainment,Performing_arts;PT6M29S;389;2d;sd;TRUE;;en-GB;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fDEwHN32lFk/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;14915;40;;0;3

Tinguely is perhaps most famous for the ambitious and influential 'Homage to New York', an auto-destructive work that failed spectacularly to destroy itself in 1960. In 2001 Michael Landy successfully destroyed all of his worldly possessions for Break Down, a project he presented in an abandoned department store in London's Oxford Street.

A long-standing fan, Serota talks about Twombly's technique, his relationship to Turner, and how the artist, now in his eighties, is still producing some of the most vital work of his career. One of the most highly regarded painters working today and a foremost figure among the generation of American artists that includes Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol. Twombly rose to prominence through a distinctive style characterised by scribbles and vibrantly daubed paint. This is his first solo retrospective in fifteen years, and provides an overview of his work from the 1950s to now. Twombly emerged as a painter at the height of Abstract Expressionism, then in 1957 he left America for Italy, where he drew inspiration from European literature and classical culture. At the heart of the exhibition is Twombly’s work exploring the cycles associated with seasons, nature and the passing of time. Several key groups are brought together for the first time, such as Tate’s Four Seasons 1993–4 with those from the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The exhibition also explores how Twombly is influenced by antiquity, myth and the Mediterranean, for example the violent red swirls in the Bacchus 2005 paintings which bring to mind the drunken god of wine.

He pioneered Auto-Destructive art and famously held an 'art strike' between 1977-1980. He was also involved in the radical Fluxus movement. In 1962 his simple idea of displaying all the pages from a popular national newspaper as an art installation was rejected from an exhibition for being too politically charged. In 2008 Tate Modern invited him to re-stage the piece, and he told us why newspapers should be held up for scrutiny.;Gustav Metzger,Auto-Destructive art,Fluxus (Art Period/Movement),Art,Artist,Interview;22;People & Blogs;Society;PT4M13S;253;2d;sd;FALSE;;;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a7sbfNIemF0/maxresdefault.jpg;;;;;13022;41;;0;4

Tate Liverpool's latest exhibition aims to convey the sheer diversity, confidence and ambition of art being made in China today. Artists include Yang Fudong, Xu Zhen, Ai Weiwei and Yangjiang Group. These predominantly young artists have chosen to remain in China, unlike many of the generation before them, and the majority of the work on show is seen for the first time outside the country. The Real Thing: Contemporary Art from China brings to Liverpool art from one of the world’s most dynamic and culturally sophisticated countries at a time of unprecedented interest in the country. Despite the proliferation of exhibitions internationally of contemporary Chinese art, this is the first major exhibition in the UK to demonstrate the depth and range of work from China, and presents some of the most interesting and important art to be made since 2000, as well as an opportunity to see the latest work by China’s leading artists. The Real Thing comprises a majority of works that are either shown for the first time outside of China, or were specially commissioned for the exhibition. The title, The Real Thing, can be taken straight, as an indication that the exhibition is a true reflection of contemporary art in China today. These predominantly young contemporary artists, largely based around Beijing and Shanghai, have chosen to remain in China, unlike many of the generation before them, and are moving towards a self-confidence and maturity that stems from an understanding of the contemporary world, China’s place within it, as well as the contemplation of their own individual positions within a society at a time of rapid, and profound cultural change. The Real Thing can also be taken ironically – humour and irony characterise much of the art currently made in China. The sheer scale, range and ambition of many of the works, demonstrate the vivacity, energy, skill, and imagination of these artists.;Contemporary Art (Art Period/Movement),China (Country),Chinese Art,Tate Liverpool (Museum),Yang Fudong (Visual Artist),Xu Zhen,Ai Weiwei (Visual Artist),Yangjiang Group,Art,Artist;22;People & Blogs;Hobby,Lifestyle_(sociology);PT3M51S;231;2d;sd;FALSE;;;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W9trSYt8mQI/maxresdefault.jpg;1;;;;2682;16;;0;0

Her new work Shibboleth is a long snaking fissure that ran the vast length of the Turbine Hall, as if striking to the very foundations of the museum. Something similar might be said of the concept that underpins the piece. The word 'shibboleth' refers back to an incident in the Bible, which describes how the Ephraimites, attempting to flee across the river Jordan, were stopped by their enemies, the Gileadites. As their dialect did not include a 'sh' sound, those who could not say the word 'shibboleth' were captured and executed. A shibboleth is therefore a token of power: the power to judge, reject and kill. What might it mean to refer to such violence in a museum of modern art? For Salcedo, the crack represents a history of racism, running parallel to the history of modernity; a stand off between rich and poor, northern and southern hemispheres. She invites us to look down into it, and to confront discomforting truths about our world.

Abdul calls her pieces 'anti-monuments', and in Dome we see a small boy dancing alone in the centre of a bombed-out building in Kabul. The boy's circling movements trace the shape of the roofless dome as he looks up at the sky, then comes the sinister throbbing of whirling rotor blades as a helicopter passes overhead. #TateShots Subscribe for weekly films: http://goo.gl/X1ZnEl;Lida Abdul (Person),Afghanistan (Country),Dome,Kabul (City/Town/Village),Art,Interview,Educational Film (Film Genre),Artist,Tate Modern London (Museum);27;Education;Entertainment;PT3M3S;183;2d;sd;FALSE;;en;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XVaIJsB6aIE/maxresdefault.jpg;1;;;;3628;28;;0;0

In this TateShots, he gets up close to Cy Twombly's epic canvases 'The Four Seasons' to explain why the American painter is one of his all-time heroes.

Bob and Roberta Smith is in fact just one person, otherwise known as British artist Patrick Brill. His paintings look like signboards, featuring slogans in brightly coloured lettering. They have the air of revolutionary statements, riffing on life, politics and art, though with a tinge of absurdity that leaves you wondering just what the message really is.

The artist talks about her enduring love for paint. Her abstract canvases are an exuberant collision of painting styles: encrusted surfaces, brushy swathes and watery pools, along with kitsch cartoon elements, which somehow coalesce despite their differences.

In the early 1970s Michael Craig-Martin created his famous sculpture An Oak Tree. The work consists of a glass of water standing on a shelf. On the wall next to it a text by the artist argues that, despite what your eyes tell you, the glass of water is in fact an oak tree. In the spirit of Duchamp, Craig-Martin provokes questions about what we understand to be art and unpicks the relationship between a real object and its depiction.

The extraordinary sculpture that resulted is a favourite in Tate's collection. Dorothy Cross was born in Cork, Ireland in 1956. She attended the Crawford Municipal School of Art in Cork before undertaking degree studies at Leicester Polytechnic, England, from 1974 to 1977. She also studied at the San Francisco Art Institute, California, 1978-9 and 1980-2. Cross has had a number of solo exhibitions including, in recent years, Dorothy Cross, Ebb, at The Douglas Hyde Gallery, Dublin 1988, Parthenon at Camden Arts Centre, London 1992, and Even: Recent Work by Dorothy Cross at the Arnolfini, Bristol in 1996. Important recent group exhibitions include Bad Girls, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, in 1993 and Fetishism: Visualising Power and Desire, first shown at Brighton Museum and Art Gallery in 1995. Cross uses a wide range of materials in her work, including found objects which have been in her family's possession for many years, constructed objects, photographs and animal skins. She has recently made several works using cow hides and, in particular, cows' udders. Central to her work as a whole are themes of sexual and cultural identity, personal history and memory. The artist lives and works in Dublin.
