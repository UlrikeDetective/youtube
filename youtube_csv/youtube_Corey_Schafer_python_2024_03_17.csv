If you've watched my videos before, you have likely noticed I use the Sublime Text text editor for the tutorials. I use this for the videos because it is very clean and easy to use without all the bells and whistles of a full blown IDE. But there are times when an IDE is extremely useful. For example, if you need to debug your application, an IDE is likely what you would like to use. There are several other options out there for Python IDEs. But Eclipse is free open source software. It can also be used to program in several other languages.

When someone prints your article or blog post, you want them to know where your links would have taken them so that they can investigate those sources further if they desire. However, you don't want to include every link in the print stylesheet. Your internal links that loop back to your own website aren't necessary and will bog down the print stylesheet with a lot of unneeded text. So how do we add only the external links to the print stylesheet? In this video, we will cover several techniques you can use in order to achieve this. ✅ Support My Channel Through Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/coreyms ✅ Become a Channel Member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g/join ✅ One-Time Contribution Through PayPal: https://goo.gl/649HFY ✅ Cryptocurrency Donations: Bitcoin Wallet - 3MPH8oY2EAgbLVy7RBMinwcBntggi7qeG3 Ethereum Wallet - 0x151649418616068fB46C3598083817101d3bCD33 Litecoin Wallet - MPvEBY5fxGkmPQgocfJbxP6EmTo5UUXMot ✅ Corey's Public Amazon Wishlist http://a.co/inIyro1 ✅ Equipment I Use and Books I Recommend: https://www.amazon.com/shop/coreyschafer ▶️ You Can Find Me On: My Website - http://coreyms.com/ My Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/c/coreymschafer Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CoreyMSchafer Twitter - https://twitter.com/CoreyMSchafer Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/coreymschafer/","CSS,CSS Tricks,CSS Tips,CSS Tips and Tricks,CSS-Tricks,Stylesheet,Print Stylesheet,CSS Print Stylesheet,Video Tutorial,How To,How-to,Coding,Web Design,Web Development,Web Dev,Cascading Style Sheets (Programming Language),Tips And Tricks,Media Query,Media Queries,CSS Media Query,CSS Media Queries,CSS Tutorials,CSS Tutorial",27,"Education","Knowledge,Technology","false"
