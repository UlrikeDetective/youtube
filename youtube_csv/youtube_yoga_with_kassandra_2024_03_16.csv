There will be a good mix of strengthening and heat building poses as well as cooling and flexibility focused poses. If you're interested in learning more about Tapas and the Yama & Niyama, check out my course here: https://bit.ly/ywkyama If you're new to minimal cues, it just means that I won't be giving you any detailed alignment prompts as we go. I'm simply going to call out the name of the poses and go through the sequence with you. This can be a great way to practice for those of you who are already yoga teachers or more intermediate students. The idea is to create space for you to listen to yourself and turn your attention inwards. However, this means I can't tell you how to do the poses so you need to be knowledgeable enough to do them safely.

This is a full body flexibility class suitable for all levels. I recommend having two blocks nearby or a bolster. If you've been feeling depleted, stressed, burnt out or overwhelmed, this is a lovely practice to help you soothe your nervous system and get back to yourself. I don't talk very much when I teach yin yoga because I want you to take the opportunity to go inward and listen to your body's inherent wisdom. Less is always more in yin yoga. I'll take you through poses like supported fish, supported bridge/butterfly, half butterfly, straddle, pigeon pose, child's pose and savasana. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

Today's class is actually a remake of a class I originally taught here in 2015. I've been on YouTube for nearly a decade now so I have tons of old classes that have great sequences but were poorly filmed. I had no idea what I was doing back then!! ;) I've revamped the sequence a touch as I teach a bit differently these days. This class is a 30 minute intermediate vinyasa flow practice to stretch and strengthen your side body. This includes your obliques, sides of your glutes and down the legs for the IT band and abductors. Here's my original side body yoga class, filmed in 2015: https://youtu.be/jTD_5CB6-JU I find the side body can be neglected in many yoga sequences, so today we will focus on it extensively. You can expect a lot of side bending poses, core strengthening poses that target the obliques, asymmetrical balancing poses and hip openers. We'll be doing poses like side plank, half moon, twisted pigeon and exalted low lunge.

Pisces is all about transitions, connecting with the power of the in-between and holding space for duality. Think of themes like death and rebirth, beginnings and endings, the conscious and the unconscious, fantasy and reality. There is a great connection to spirituality, intuition and the highest self while also being highly empathetic and compassionate. There is a relationship with the crown sahasrara chakra which relates to spiritual connection as well as the third eye chakra which relates to intuition and imagination. The archetype for Pisces is the Mystic. They are highly adaptable and can use their imagination and connection to something greater to generate creativity. This will be a 20 minute yoga flow best suited for beginner to intermediate students with no props required. This is a full body practice with emphasis on poses that help us connect to the third eye and crown chakra. Affirmations for Pisces: - I embrace all of my emotions - My highest self guides me - I am adaptable and creative Whether you believe in astrology or not, you are welcome here! It can be fun to fuse our practice with meaning and symbolism through different lenses and perspectives. These themes allow us to connect with different parts of ourselves and can help us grow.

Capricorn is a cardinal earth sign which relates strongly to the root muladhara chakra. Themes associated with this zodiac sign include safety, stability, ambition, determination, hard work, high achievement as well as being grounded and rooted. Capricorn's have the amazing ability to get things done! The core belief is that through commitment and discipline, anything is possible. There is also a strong need to find a sense of purpose and mission in life. Sometimes they need to be reminded that it is okay to slow down, to do less and to ask for help. They are associated with the archetype of the Midfwife because of their ability to birth their vision into the world. We will tap into the energy of determination and commitment by repeating yoga poses 10 times throughout this sequence and we will work on lower body yoga poses to connect with the root chakra. Affirmations for Capricorn: - I set clear goals - I am safe and supported - I am committed and consistent Whether you believe in astrology or not, you are welcome here!

Thank you for joining me in this 45 minute yin yoga class which will focus on your upper body, specifically your back, chest and shoulders. If you have tightness, tension or knots in your back, this will be a great sequence for you to do. This class is suitable for all access levels and you'll want to have two blocks close by. I'll take you through a breathing exercise in the beginning to help you open up your shoulders and then we'll do poses like reclined twist, forward fold, child's pose, puppy pose, sphinx and supported fish. Remember that in yin yoga we usually hold poses for 3-5 minutes. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student.

This will be a yin yoga class that helps us connect with the third eye ajna chakra and the sacral svadhistana chakra. Scorpio is associated with themes of shadow work, magic, intuition, intimacy, sexuality, death, rebirth and depth. Scoprio is a fixed water sign that relates to the deep waters of the self. Scorpio is associated with the archetype of the King or Queen of Death due to its ability to let things go and to transform. This will be a practice to facilitate shadow work and to help you turn in to yourself and listen. Turn towards those parts of yourself that you repress, suppress or deny. Explore the depths of your psyche and welcome the energy of Scorpio into your practice. This 30 minute yin yoga practice is suitable for all levels and will use 2 blocks. We will focus on poses that open up our hips and connect to the space of the third eye. We will be in each pose for 3-4 minutes so remember not to push yourself too far. We are not chasing sensation, we want to be able to relax deeply. Affirmations for Scorpio: - I feel deeply - I trust my intuition - I embrace all parts of myself Whether you believe in astrology or not, you are welcome here! It can be fun to fuse our practice with meaning and symbolism through different lenses and perspectives. These themes allow us to connect with different parts of ourselves and can help us grow.

This is a 30 minute full body flow that will have a lot of verbal cues to tap into the analytical side of the mutable earth sign of Virgo. Virgos are great at analyzing, learning and creating order out of chaos. They represent the archetype of the Healer and are at their best when they are serving others. They are deeply connected with the physical body and can be seen as independent, grounded, reliable and smart. The shadow side of Virgo is criticism, perfectionism and judgment. This yoga class will go in-depth with verbal cues to focus on meticulous alignment. I'll be talking a lot in this class to give you lots of information on how to stay safe in each pose and get the most out of them. The idea is to care for our bodies and find order and cohesion through our movements. This is an all levels yoga class with no props required. Affirmations for Virgo: - I see the best in others and in myself - I can do anything I set my mind to - I take great care of myself Whether you believe in astrology or not, you are welcome here! It can be fun to fuse our practice with meaning and symbolism through different lenses and perspectives. These themes allow us to connect with different parts of ourselves and can help us grow.

This has been a popular request as I know a lot of you are eager to give this inversion a try. In this yoga pose tutorial, I'll go over three different conditioning exercises that will help you develop the strength needed to support yourself in headstand before showing you different ways of getting into this pose. With headstand, it's super important to remember that most of your body weight is not resting on your head and neck, it's actually being supported by your arms and back. You need to have a lot of strength to safely do this pose. Please remember that inversions and arm balances can be really fun ways to challenge yourself, but they aren't necessary! There's no rush and no pressure to ""accomplish"" these poses. Always listen to your body and be really patient with yourself. It will take time! I'll show you three different ways of doing a supported headstand, either the knee tuck, the leg lift or the float. You'll want to have your mat near a wall to start out with.

I know most of you aren't equestrians but some of you are and lately you've been asking me to share some updates on YouTube, so here it is! In late May I got to take Java off property to go schooling for the very first time. We went to Westar and used the hunter ring and had an absolute BLAST! I'm so proud of him (and of me). This was one of the most fun days we've had together. Even though I'm never jumping more than 2'3"" it's such an amazing thrill and definitely what I love doing the most. Apologies for some of the videos being very blurry and low quality!! They were sent to me through Facebook and Instagram which heavily reduces the quality. :( The next day we had an in-house show, our very first time doing a competition together and I'm also happy with how this went. This was really hard because of how much starting and stopping there was between each class but overall he did very well. I've signed us up for more schooling level shows throughout the summer and fall and some are off property, so we'll see how he does then. If you want to follow more of my adventures and lessons with Java, I post daily on his Instagram account: https://instagram.com/javacupofjoe Java is an 9 year old Percheron x Quarter Horse standing at 16 hands tall.

I've decided to go with yin yoga for this theme as I wanted us to connect deeply with the energy of the sacral/svadhistana chakra and heart/anahata chakra. Cancer is a cardinal water sign that relates to deep feeling. I love to think of the expression ""feel it to heal it"" It's associated with the archetype of the Nurturer or the Mother. This isn't only about nurturing others, but also nurturing the self. It connects to our relationship with home & family and the inner most sanctum of the heart. Cancer signs can be very emotional but they have deep potential for unconditional love and compassion. This is a gift! Their shadow side can include clinginesss, moodiness or manipulation. This 30 minute yin yoga practice is suitable for all levels and will use 2 blocks. We will focus on poses that open up our hips and our upper body in order to free up stagnant emotions and tap into deep feeling centers. Since Cancer is the nurturer, I want this practice to be super nurturing for your physical and emotional body. We will be in each pose for 3-4 minutes so remember not to push yourself too far. We are not chasing sensation, we want to be able to relax deeply. Affirmations for Cancer: - My capacity for love is endless - I am in tune with my needs - I balance giving and receiving Whether you believe in astrology or not, you are welcome here! It can be fun to fuse our practice with meaning and symbolism through different lenses and perspectives. These themes allow us to connect with different parts of ourselves and can help us grow. Don't take yourself too seriously and just have fun with it!

This practice will take you through a 17 minute flow focusing on the mutable air sign of Gemini, my moon sign! Mutable signs are adaptable and move with change. Gemini represents the archetype of the muse and is a sign of communication, social connection, networking and learning. Geminis have quick minds and quick tongues. They can be great writers, poets, thinkers and story tellers. They find inspiration through thoughts and ideas. Gemini is also a sign of duality and there can be an overidentification with the cerebral mind and thoughts compared to feeling and embodying emotions. The shadow side of Gemini can be flaky, erratic, uncommitted, superficial, cocky, gossipy or ""judgy"", perhaps using their words against others in a negative way. This will be a fluid vinyasa flow yoga practice with some creative poses and transitions that will work on balance. No props are required although you can always have a block close by as it can be useful for poses like half moon/ardha chandrasana. This is an intermediate flow. Affirmations for Gemini: - I am innately creative - My heart and mind are in perfect harmony - My thoughts and ideas are worth sharing Whether you believe in astrology or not, you are welcome here! It can be fun to fuse our practice with meaning and symbolism through different lenses and perspectives. These themes allow us to connect with different parts of ourselves and can help us grow.

If your mental health is suffering, I would encourage you to take some time to do this practice and hopefully it will help you move through those emotions and come back to a state of equilibrium in your nervous system. I've struggled with anxiety my entire life and I find that the most beneficial way to use yoga during stressful episodes or panic attacks is by both activating and relaxing. We will do some dynamic breathing exercises to clear our minds and move our bodies to get the energy flowing before settling into some relaxation poses and slowing down.

Today I'm going to take you through a shoulder-focused yoga flow meant to help you improve your range of motion and mobility. Personally my shoulders tend to hold a lot of tightness and if you've been struggling with backbends, often it isn't spine flexibility that we need to focus on but instead it's shoulder flexibility! In this class I'm going to take you through poses and movements to free up your shoulders and increase your flexibility which will also open up your chest and upper back. You'll want to have a strap for this class or a belt or theraband. We'll be doing some shoulder flossing and going through poses like dolphin, puppy pose and laying chest openers. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

This is a very lazy practice that won't require much effort or energy so that you can focus on filling your own cup and caring for yourself deeply. I'm using a bolster for this practice but you can swap this out with some couch cushions, pillows, blankets or blocks. I want you to feel supported and comfortable throughout this sequence. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student.

This can be done as a stream of consciousness exercise where you don't censor or edit what you write.

I'm going to take you through a pretty standard practice I do before I go riding my horse. I absolutely love horseback riding but unfortunately it has created a lot of tension and stiffness in my lower body. It's important to stretch before and after each ride! This is an all levels yoga class which will work on opening up your hips and shoulders while stretching deeply through your quads, calves and hamstrings. We'll have a few low back and upper back stretches as well to make this a well rounded yoga flow. No props needed! I do very low level dressage and jumping but really this is a great sequence for riding of any kind! I plan on filming a lot more yoga for equestrian classes in the future, hopefully this Summer when I can do it in the pasture with all the horses present :) In the meantime, you can also try this one: https://youtu.be/aBBtB0gIE1k The set I'm wearing is from Praise Endurance https://www.praiseendurance.com/ ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

This is something I've had my entire life and while I will most likely always have this type of posture as my anatomical default, there are ways to improve it. It's very normal and healthy to have a curve in your lower back but if it is too pronounced it can lead to pain and issues. In this 30 minute all levels yoga class we will be focusing on 4 things: - strengthening our abdominals - strengthening our glutes - stretching our hip flexors - stretching our lower back The key to improving your anterior pelvic tilt with yoga is AWARENESS. Every time you are on your mat, you need to check in with your low back posture in every single posture. This also applies to your day to day life when you are standing and walking. Pull your lower abdominals in and lengthen your tailbone down to bring your pelvis back into neutral alignment.

I thought it was time to do a brand new chakra yin yoga class paired with affirmations from my new I Radiate Joy affirmation card deck. AFFIRMATION CARD DECK: https://bit.ly/affirmationdeck I'll take you through 7 yin yoga poses that activate the chakras from the root to the crown. I'm using one block in this class but rest assured it's not necessary, you can leave it out or substitute with some cushions or blankets. This class is suitable for all levels. This is more than just a yoga class where we stretch and strengthen. Instead, this class calls on us to dive a little bit deeper and use our yoga practice to make meaningful changes in our daily lives. The chakras can be used as metaphors and inspiration for emotional healing and well being.

What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Let's begin our day with ease by doing a little bit of yin yoga. This is a slow and sweet practice suitable for all experience levels with no props required. This will help you increase flexibility and each pose will be held for 2 minutes or so. I'll guide you through poses like deer, butterfly, wide legged forward fold and child's pose. I'm also going to draw a card from my I Radiate Joy affirmation card deck to help us set the tone for the day :) Buy the deck here: https://bit.ly/affirmationdeck 😍 Practice with me EVERY MORNING 👉 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0v0k7UCVrkh5WZyHu0d0fWnaNgbmQTw There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. I usually teach poses held for around 4-5 minutes. Learn to surrender and keep a timer close by if needed. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

We'll be pairing each pose with an affirmation from my new I RADIATE JOY affirmation card deck (https://bit.ly/affirmationdeck). Please have two blocks handy or you can substitute with couch cushions, pillows or thick blankets. We'll be doing poses like straddle, half saddle, shoelace, sphinx and reclined twist. I'm joined by my foster cat Maggie in the beginning :) The Winter solstice is a paradox and a time of transition to honor darkness as well as the return of light. It marks the longest night of the year as well as the return of sunlight as we move towards Spring. The last thing we want to do during the Winter solstice is overexert ourselves! This is a great time to pause and do less. This time of the year is all about resting, saying no, sleeping and tuning in to what we truly want. A flower is not meant to blossom year round and we aren't either. Winter is a time for us to hibernate physically, mentally and emotionally. While we can't actually sleep for months, Winter is a beautiful opportunity to reduce the amount of activities, tasks and stresses you normally have.

Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

An Have you ever cried while in a yoga pose or burst into laughter or become really angry? If so you’re not alone. This is commonly called an emotional release, let’s talk about it. You might have heard me say before, especially in a yin yoga class, that releasing physical tension from our bodies allows us to also release emotional, mental and spiritual tension as well.

Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. I usually teach poses held for around 4-5 minutes. Learn to surrender and keep a timer close by if needed. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

A year ago I started horseback riding and 6 months ago I bought my horse Java. My life has completely changed since then and going on this equestrian journey has been the most challenging, fun and fulfilling thing I've ever done. It hasn't been easy and it still isn't easy, but going to the barn is definitely the best part of my day. So, come with me as I head out to my dressage lesson and then try to take Java on a hack, which doesn't exactly go as planned. Please keep in mind I'm a beginner and I'm new to this, so while criticism is totally fine keep it constructive. Also keep in mind that everyone does things a bit differently and what works for your horse might not work for mine and vice versa. I do a mix of R- and R+ training depending on the situation and the goal we're trying to achieve and that's what works best for us. If you want to follow more of my adventures and lessons with Java, I post daily on his instagram account: https://instagram.com/javacupofjoe Java is an 8 year old Percheron x Quarter Horse standing at 16 hands tall. He's a big boy with a great big personality and tons of potential. We ride in English style and do a bit of dressage and jumping. He's still a bit green and I'm very very green.. so we are doing our best! :) ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

This targets the groin, inner leg and adductors which is linked with the kidney meridian. This is a great class to do if you're also working on middle splits. We can hold a lot of tension in this part of our bodies and especially since I've started horseback riding I've noticed how stiff the inner thighs can get. I'm using a small bolster for this practice but you can easily substitute it with some blocks or pillows. This is an intermediate yin yoga class. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

I've had an exaggerated lumbar curve or lordosis for as long as I can remember and have used yoga to help me correct and improve my posture. It's very normal and healthy to have a curve in your lower back but if it is too pronounced it can lead to pain and issues. The main things to focus on are: 1 - Core strength: making sure to hug the belly button back towards the spine and properly engage the lower abdominals 2 - Hip flexor stretch: short and tight hip flexors can pull your pelvis forward and exaggerate the tilt. 3 - Posture: Correcting your posture throughout the day and during your yoga practice is the most important.

I'm going to take you through an hour long yin yoga practice for flexibility and stress relief. This is a really relaxing full body stretch that can be practiced at any time of the day. It's suitable for all levels but you might want to have some props close by to help make some poses more accessible. If you don't own any blocks you can always use some blankets or pillows from around the house. We'll be holding each pose for 3-4 minutes, remember not to go too deep into each pose. Try to relax into the stretch and let go. There are 3 principles to yin yoga and it's crucial to keep these in mind! 1 - Find your edge: this means, don't push yourself! When you feel a bit of sensation, hold right here. Your body will naturally relax and open up the longer we're in it. 2 - Resolve to be still: Relax your muscles and let gravity do most of the work for you. Try not to stiffen up and contract yourself. If your muscles are tense it might be an indication that you've gone too far into a stretch. 3 - Hold the pose: Once you're fully relaxed, we're going to stay in the pose for 3-4 minutes. Please come out of it earlier if you need to! Don't push yourself.

Learn the basics of a yin yoga practice and it's philosophy. 🎓 STUDY WITH ME 🧘 VINYASA TEACHING METHODOLOGIES 🎓 👉 https://bit.ly/yttvinyasa ❤️ Try my mobile app to get exclusive content! ❤️📱 👉 http://bit.ly/ytmobileapp You can watch a more detailed overview of the principles of yin yoga in this video: https://youtu.be/xyAY1zyuDeg What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. I usually teach poses held for around 4-5 minutes. Learn to surrender and keep a timer close by if needed. Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

I've had to remind myself to let go of expectations when I practice recently and to not judge my body so harshly. I've mentioned a bit that I have this very annoying arthritis in my big left toe and for a long time I was pain free and my mobility was great, but the past two weeks have been awful! The pain has been excruciating and it's such a small part of your body but it affects so much! I couldn't do any kind of lunge or any pose that requires flexion there, so even just going through a vinyasa was out of the question. Walking was uncomfortable. I'm not sure what caused the flair up, maybe weather, but thankfully the past 2 days I've been pain free, so hopefully I'm on the other side of it! I work on it every day very diligently with stretches, exercises, supplements, etc. But you can't always prevent a flair up and I have to find a way to be in the HERE and NOW with my body. No expectations. Lots of curiosity. And gratitude. We never know what tomorrow will bring. The way we feel in our bodies today could change in the blink of an eye, for better or for worse.

I've got a fun and challenging flow for you today. Let me guide you through a 30 minute yoga class focusing on sun salutations, surya namaskar. This is a longer and updated version of this class I did a few years ago: https://youtu.be/ZP34IA0d8LI Sun salutations are a wonderful way to build strength and flexibility while also building the mind-body connection. I'll be taking you through half sun salutations, sun salutations A, Sun salutations B and hatha surya namaskar. We will also have a few balancing standing poses in between each flow and we will end with some hip openers. Sun salutations are an excellent way to begin the day so this would make a great morning yoga practice. The poses in this practice are all suitable for beginners but because of the pacing, length and speed of this class it might be best suited for intermediate level students. It's a fun class that you can do over and over again and improve over time. No props needed.

Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them.

Here are some yoga stretches to do after your ride. 🎓 STUDY WITH ME 🧘 VINYASA TEACHING METHODOLOGIES 🎓 👉 https://bit.ly/yttvinyasa ❤️ Try my mobile app to get exclusive content! ❤️📱 👉 http://bit.ly/ytmobileapp This summer I started taking riding lessons and have absolutely fallen in love with it. I ride three times a week (English) and I have to say, I think yoga has been my saving grace! If you have stiffness, tightness, tension or soreness in your body, this class will help you work through it which in turn will benefit your riding. This is a 20 minute yoga class suitable for beginners and all levels. No previous yoga experience is necessary and even if you aren't an equestrian, you'll probably love the way this stretch feels! These are the stretches I usually do when I get home from my lesson. They will work a lot on your inner thighs, quads, ankles and lower back but of course we will also get a few stretches in for our back and shoulders. It's a well rounded simple practice that any equestrian can benefit from, no matter how experienced or flexible you might be! Flexibility can have an amazing positive impact on your riding, regardless of your discipline! I hope you enjoy this class :) Let me know if you'd like more ""equestrian"" themed flows on my channel.

In each pose you'll hear me state one affirmation which you are encouraged to internally repeat. Notice how the statement makes you feel and if it creates resistance. Keep a journal close by to make note of anything that may have come up for you. Affirmations used: - I treat my body with love and respect - I allow all parts of me to be expressed - In this moment, I release all thoughts of worry - When challenges arise, I stay anchored in hope - I allow myself to slow down and rest - My self-esteem is growing day by day - I send healing energy to all parts of my body What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them.

I'll take you through poses like supported fish, butterfly, shoelace with side bend, straddle, reclined knee to chest and supported bridge. This is suitable for all experience levels and by the end you should feel relaxed, rejuvenated and more comfortable in your body. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

BROWSE ALL MY YIN YOGA CLASSES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0v0k7UCVrmK5WvoJMCAof0LJxuQXqxk What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. I usually teach poses held for around 4-5 minutes. Learn to surrender and keep a timer close by if needed. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Here's a 75 minute yin yoga class for deep flexibility with extra long holds. Normally when I teach yin yoga I hold each pose for about 3-4 minutes. In this practice, I'm holding them for about 7-8 minutes, which makes this class best suited for intermediate to advanced students. MUSIC PLAYLIST FOR THIS CLASS: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5fdgh21EQotm9UjI3I2xk9?si=b28280d1b3214ecb The poses themselves aren't all that challenging but since we're in them for so long it might not be suitable for everyone. Don't underestimate the mental challenge with this one! I'm not using any props and we're going to do poses like half butterfly, swan, sphinx, seal and cat pulling it's tail. There are 3 principles to yin yoga and it's crucial to keep these in mind! 1 - Find your edge: this means, don't push yourself! When you feel a bit of sensation, hold right here. Your body will naturally relax and open up the longer we're in it. 2 - Resolve to be still: Relax your muscles and let gravity do most of the work for you. Try not to stiffen up and contract yourself. If your muscles are tense it might be an indication that you've gone too far into a stretch. 3 - Hold the pose: Once you're fully relaxed, we're going to stay in the pose for 7-8 minutes. Please come out of it earlier if you need to!

You guys know I love using these and I find it to be such a powerful way to start the day. An affirmation is a positive statement said in the present tense. You can do this meditation every single day either seated or lying down. As I you listen to the affirmations, simply repeat them internally to yourself a few times. Notice what they bring up in you. It's normal for some affirmations to feel good while others may trigger some discomfort or resistance. This is a great opportunity for introspection and I highly recommend journaling after this meditation to uncover the source of your feelings towards the affirmations.

Fostering is very important to me and something I am passionate about. I previously had a family of 4 kittens and their mom for 3.5 months but they've all been adopted out. (You'll see them in some videos I filmed a month ago.) I thought I would take a break once they were adopted because it is difficult to let them go. However, I just couldn't turn this family down. This mom and her 3 babies were rescued from a kill shelter where she had been labelled as feral and aggressive so no one took her in. Her time was running out. Thankfully the rescue I volunteer with agreed to take her in and we quickly found out that she is not feral or aggressive at all!! She is the complete opposite. Gentle, sweet, curious, affectionate. We're not really sure why she was labelled like that. This poor girl is young and incredibly thin, she really deserved a second chance and so did her babies. Now they're with me and I'll keep them until they're all ready for adoption :) If you're looking for a pet please consider adopting. If you're interested in fostering all I can say is do it!!! Of course it's hard to let them go but it is so incredibly rewarding to know you've literally saved lives. You'll probably see Marshmallow, Buttercup, Strudel and Waffles in some videos on my channel, so stay tuned. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

As you can tell, I'm not in my usual filming spot. I went to the Sweet Sanctuary Animal Rescue in Carleton Place, Ontario and got to practice with some lovely farm companions :) This class is suitable for all levels and no props are needed. It's just a simple and fun yoga class in the company of little piggies. I've been doing monthly donations to this rescue for a few years now because I really love and admire the work that they do. They give these animals a chance to live out their best lives and covid has made it really difficult for them to fundraise. So, I've decided to turn this video into a fundraiser! All ad proceeds from this class will be donated to them and I would absolutely love for you to send them a donation if you're able to. Even just a few dollars can make a difference. They are working on building a giant new barn and expanding their pastures in order to bring in more animals in need.

This is an hour long practice which begins with a dynamic vinyasa flow before finishing with a relaxing yin yoga stretch. Vinyasa yoga merges movement with breath and helps to increase strength, flexibility and endurance. Yin yoga uses passive poses held for 3-5 minutes to work on your joints and connective tissues while soothing your nervous system. The vinyasa portion of the practice will be done ""mandala"" style which means we'll be going around the mat. You might prefer having your mat parallel to the screen rather than facing towards it, but that's up to you. No props are needed and this is a true intermediate class for your entire body. Normally yin yoga is practiced with cold muscles, before a vinyasa practice. Personally, I prefer to do it after but it's important to remember to hold back a bit and not go as far since your muscles are warmed up.

This is a lovely stretch you can do in the morning with just one block. If you don't have a block, you can simply use a folded blanket or a pillow. This is suitable for all levels.

Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. I usually teach poses held for around 4-5 minutes. Learn to surrender and keep a timer close by if needed. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

In this course we explore each yama and niyama through a philosophy lecture (led my Madhura), a yoga class (taught by me) and some journaling prompts. This class is all about the third yama of asteya/non-stealing. Let's explore this concept through a meditation on the 5 senses as a way to stay anchored in the present moment. (Non-stealing from this moment) We will move into a heart opening flow with some backbends, chest openers and shoulder stretches, also using padma (lotus) mudra to connect to the heart.

Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

This is an intense thigh stretch that will target your quads and when practiced in the context of a yin yoga class, it will also target your knees. This is pose that simply is NOT meant for everyone! Even with all the proper alignment, this pose may never feel good for you and that's perfectly fine. We should NEVER feel any pain in our knees, hips or low back. We want most of the sensation to be at the front of the thighs. I'll show you how you can do supta virasana more comfortably with the help of blocks and a blanket while also going over the proper alignment. Please note that some teachers (especially in yin) teach this pose with the toes tucked under the seat, sitting on the heals. I was instructed to keep the outside the hips and find it works much better for my body. I would never claim to say that there is only one way to do a pose, this is just the way that has been the safest and best for me.

It's normal for some affirmations to feel good while others may trigger some discomfort or resistance. This is a great opportunity for introspection and I highly recommend journaling after this meditation to uncover the source of your feelings towards the affirmations. AFFIRMATIONS: I allow myself to slow down and enjoy life I treat my body with love and respect I am willing to change and grow I trust the timing of my life I am at peace with the flow of life I look in the mirror and love what I see I trust my insight and intuition I inspire others by being myself I am blessed, grateful and abundant I allow al parts of me to be expressed I find balance between giving and receiving I value my own beliefs and opinions I shift from competition to collaboration I step into my power with confidence and grace My self-esteem is growing day by day ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. I usually teach poses held for around 4-5 minutes. Learn to surrender and keep a timer close by if needed. 👚 CROP TOP HOODIE IS FROM POPFLEX ⚡️ https://lddy.no/r3g5 ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. I usually teach poses held for around 4-5 minutes. Learn to surrender and keep a timer close by if needed. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

I don't know about you, but I could use some grounding right about now. If you're feeling stressed, worried or anxious, this full body yin yoga class will use affirmations to help inspire hope and peace. This is an almost hour long practice suitable for all levels and no props are needed to participate. AFFIRMATIONS: I choose to be gentle and kind with all beings, including myself. In this moment, I release thoughts of worry. I am present. I have faith in the innate goodness of people. I calm my nervous system by taking deep breaths. When challenges arise, I stay anchored in hope. I have a big heart and that's a wonderful thing. My strength comes from my ability to dream of a better future for all. I am never alone and I reach out for support when I need it. My thoughts, words and actions are grounded in love. If something comes up for you doing the practice, journaling is a great way to process your experience. Using affirmations is a great way to do shadow work. Uncovering those parts of yourself that have been cast away, rejected or suppressed. If you find yourself being triggered in affirmations, simply notice it and journal on it later to see what could be at the root of that. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. I usually teach poses held for around 4-5 minutes.

This is a true intermediate practice with a few challenges thrown in to help you build strength and improve your balance. This was one of the first classes I filmed in my new home studio, I hope you'll like it :) The studio isn't quite ready yet but it's been so fun for me to record in the comfort of my own home.

You can then expect some hip openers and there will be an option for a headstand. I'm not using any props in this class but you can certainly have them if needed.

If you've been feeling insecure, unstable or worried, this should be a wonderful yoga practice for you.

It deals with scarcity or abundance mindsets and relates to the first stage of infancy when we rely on our parents to care for our needs. To have a balanced root chakra means that you feel safe in the physical world.

Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

Something I could personally use a bit more of lately.. This is a lovely full body stretch and you'll need two blocks. If you don't have these close by, you can use some pillows or cushions. By first opening the body and softening in this way, I find it so much easier to get in touch with the emotional body. This is a full body Yin Yoga practice to open up your chest, low back, hips and hamstrings. In each pose you'll hear me state one affirmation which you are encouraged to internally repeat. Notice how the statement makes you feel and if it creates resistance. Keep a journal close by to make note of anything that may have come up for you. AFFIRMATIONS USED: My day begins and ends with gratitude and joy. Good things are coming my way, I'm ready. I choose to feel optimistic, confident and capable. Joy is my birthright.

Triangle pose can be tricky because most students believe it's about touching the floor, but I'm confident that these tips will help you make the balancing process a bit easier :) There are some common misalignment and misconceptions about triangle pose. Rather than aiming to get low and touch the floor, we're looking for dynamic activation through both legs, length in the spine and length through the arms. As if we were expanding in all directions!

Whether you want to focus on physical, mental, emotional or spiritual healing, this full body class will use affirmations to help you connect to this intention. This 30 minute yin yoga class doesn't require any props but if you have some at home, keep them close by just in case. I really hope this class can be a source of support and solace in your time of need. These poses are quite deep so I would say this is an intermediate level practice. AFFIRMATIONS USED: I give myself permission to heal inside and out. Every cell in my body is vibrant and healthy. Wellness is my natural state. I see my current circumstances as opportunities to grow. I now free myself from destructive fears and doubts. I am gentle with myself through the healing process. My mind, body and spirit are in perfect harmony. If something comes up for you doing the practice, journaling is a great way to process your experience. Using affirmations is a great way to do shadow work.. uncovering those parts of yourself that have been cast away, rejected or suppressed. If you find yourself being triggered in affirmations, simply notice it and journal on it later to see what could be at the root of that. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

You don't need any props for this practice but I do encourage you to have a journal close by. I'm a big lover of affirmations and like to pair them with yin yoga asanas as a way to do shadow work and dig deep. We'll be doing yin yoga asanas like child's pose, sphinx, reclined butterfly, sleeping swan and banana. AFFIRMATIONS USED: Today I celebrate the joy and wonder within me. Peace and harmony surround me at all times. I am patient with myself and others, we are all doing our best. I breathe in to nourish my spirit. I breathe out to soften and relax. My internal dialogue is kind and loving. All that I need to know at any given moment is revealed to me. I send out healing energy into the world and I lovingly receive it back. In this moment I am grounded, present and serene. If something comes up for you doing the practice, journaling is a great way to process your experience. Using affirmations is a great way to do shadow work.. uncovering those parts of yourself that have been cast away, rejected or suppressed. If you find yourself being triggered in affirmations, simply notice it and journal on it later to see what could be at the root of that. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

Blocks aren't necessary for this class but I do recommend having two or grabbing some cushions from around the house. This is a full body yin yoga class to improve your flexibility. We'll get into some more challenging yin yoga asanas making this an intermediate level class. Enjoy! What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

If you want to improve your overall flexibility and relieve stress, this is the perfect class for you. Stretch out your hips, shoulders, hamstrings and low back with this lovely sequence that will leave you feeling rejuvenated and comfortable in your own body. This is a great class to do regularly if you're trying to improve flexibility and mobility in your joints. You'll need two blocks for this practice and you can use some yoga jellies for more cushioning of the knees. YOGA JELLIES: https://amzn.to/2QCoNvx What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Meditation can be intimidating at first and it's often quite hard to quiet down our mind. I find the mantra meditation to be an excellent technique for inner stillness. All you'll need to do is sit or lay down, breathe mindfully and internally repeat the mantra ""So Hum"" which roughly translates to ""I Am That"". This is an opportunity for the ego to dissolve, creating internal space and inner peace. It's only 5 minutes long and can be done as a morning meditation or an evening meditation. Once you get comfortable with this technique you can increase the length and even choose a different mantra to work with. Please let me know if you'd like to see more meditation on my channel, I'd be happy to introduce you to other techniques that have worked for me. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

After this practice you will feel calm and peaceful. This is a 30 minute full body yin yoga stretch that uses props. Make sure you have a block or two and get close to a wall as we'll do some restorative wall yoga poses. This is a great practice to do in the evening to unwind from your busy day. I'll invite you to repeat these affirmations internally: I am calm. I am at peace. All is well and I am safe. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

This is a beginner yin yoga class to increase flexibility in your hips and legs while also relieving lower back pain. We'll also stretch a bit into the glutes and quads. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

Since we're working on the heart and lung meridians, these poses will focus on the upper body. Have two blocks close by and create a safe space for yourself to experience this practice. The only way out is through. This is not about convincing ourselves that we're ""over it"", it's about allowing ourselves to feel exactly what we feel, the good and the bad.

This week we're doing a slow vinyasa flow for sexual health and vitality. This is a great practice to increase your libido and overall sex drive. You can expect quite a few hip openers and emphasis on breathing in this practice. No props required. This class will work on sexual health by focusing on three different areas: 1 - Physical: We'll release tension from the hips and pelvis to improve circulation and support a healthy pelvic floor. 2 - Emotional: We'll show ourselves some love and learn to accept and feel pleasure. This is about healing the emotional relationship you have with your sexuality. 3 - Energetic: We'll move prana/chi throughout the body to remove blockages that are holding you back from full vitality using breathing and yoga poses. I was a bit hesitant to create a practice like this online but I know how healing and powerful yoga can be to restore sexual vitality.

This 45 minute yin yoga class will help you stretch out and relieve tension in your hips, low back, glutes and inner thighs. I'll take you through some of my favorite hip opening yoga stretches to help you improve flexibility. Yin yoga is a wonderful practice for your hips so I really hope you enjoy this one. Some of the yoga poses can be a bit intense so make sure you have plenty of props around you. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints.

It's meant to elevate your heart rate and challenge you. The second half of the practice winds things down by focusing on flexibility and getting into the fascia. Normally yin yoga is practiced with cold muscles, before a vinyasa practice. Personally, I prefer to do it after but it's important to remember to hold back a bit and not go as far since your muscles are warmed up.

Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

By popular demand, I've paired this practice with affirmations and we are focusing on the theme of inner peace and guidance. Using affirmations in yin yoga is something I've personally been doing for years and I'm so happy you've resonated with it. I've been doing audio affirmations for a long time and love it a lot but there's something so special about pairing it with yoga poses, especially in yin. You'll need to have one block for today's practice and I highly recommend keeping a journal and pen close by. If something comes up for you doing the practice, journaling is a great way to process your experience. Using affirmations is a great way to do shadow work.. uncovering those parts of yourself that have been cast away, rejected or suppressed. If you find yourself being triggered in affirmations, simply notice it and journal on it later to see what could be at the root of that. Affirmations: All is well in my world and I am safe. I let go of the past and move joyfully into the present. My inner self always knows what to do. I trust that my life is unfolding exactly as it should. I feel deeply connected to my own spirit. I am willing to be at peace with myself and others. I am aligned with my higher purpose. I release the need to change or control others. I radiate peace, love and well being. Every breath I take brings me more tranquility. What is Yin Yoga?

There is actually so much going on in Warrior 2 and it can be very easy to have bad alignment. I probably could've added so much more to this video but I wanted to keep it short and sweet so that you'd watch it all the way through ;) I'll give you my most important alignment techniques focusing on the 3 key joints involved: ankles, knees and hips! Hopefully it will help you out and make you more conscious of your posture next time you're in virabhadrasana II. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Stretch out your hips, shoulders, hamstrings and low back with this lovely sequence that will leave you feeling rejuvenated and comfortable in your own body. This is a great class to do regularly if you're trying to improve flexibility and mobility in your joints. You will need a block for this practice and a blanket is optional but nice to have. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student.

Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student.

This is a 40 minute yin yoga sequence to help you stretch and release tension from your neck, shoulders, mid back, upper back and chest. I recommend having two blocks for this class. You can expect to do poses like broken wing, sphinx, supported butterfly and bowtie. This class is suitable for all experience levels. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student.

Taking time to turn inwards and connect with your soul purpose is a vital part of maintaining focus and clarity throughout the year. What do you want to let go of?

Sun salutations are a wonderful practice to elevate your heart rate while strengthening and stretching your entire body. We'll begin with a quick warmup and then move to some half sun salutations followed by a few rounds of Sun Salutation A and then Sun Salutation B. We'll wind down with a standing forward fold, malasana and a seated twist before closing with a short meditation. Modify and take breaks if you need to! It can take a while to build strength in this type of movement but practicing it regularly will help you start your day on the right foot.

Today I'm offering you a 35 minute yoga practice with minimal verbal cues ideal for Yoga Teachers or experienced students. I already have two of these classes on my channel and you guys have been asking me to make more. Minimal cues means that I won't be giving you any alignment tips in this class or breathing instructions, I'll only be naming the poses. This is why this yoga flow is best suited for more experienced yoga practitioners. You'll need to know how to modify poses yourself. The sequence is intermediate level. I love doing online yoga classes myself but as a teacher I don't always want to listen to the other teacher explain every single thing about a pose. Sometimes it's nice to just be guided in your practice and make room for silence to make it a meditative practice!

So, by popular request, I've made a new one. As you most likely know, yin yoga tends to be quite prop intensive using blocks, straps, bolsters, blankets and many other items that you might not always have around. If you're travelling or just low on props, this yin yoga class will take you through a 40 minute sequence you can do without equipment! Of course, I'm a big lover of props so always recommend having them close by, but this is a nice class to do in a pinch :) FIRST NO PROPS YIN CLASS: https://youtu.be/3YOYyQ8cb5c What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

Answering your Yin YTT questions! 😍 ONLINE YIN YOGA TEACHER TRAINING 😍 Get certified to teach! Yoga Alliance approved 👉🏼 http://bit.ly/teachyinyoga 1. CERTIFICATION HOW DOES THE CERTIFICATION WORK? • There is no legal governing body that oversees yoga. Legally and technically, anyone can call themselves a yoga teacher and offer classes. However, ethically, this isn’t recommended. • Even if you do this yin yoga training which WILL certify you to teach yin yoga classes, you should do a 200 hour teacher training program before teaching ANY style of yoga IF YOU’RE ALREADY A TEACHER • This is certified continuing education that enables you to teach yin yoga. • You can use this training as continuing education with Yoga Alliance. It’s worth 20 non contact hours which is the maximum you’re allowed to have every year. IF YOU’RE NOT A TEACHER • This training will deepen your knowledge of yin yoga and help you improve your home practice. 2. HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO COMPLETE THE COURSE? Forever! This is self-paced meaning you start and stop whenever you’d like. You can take as many breaks as you want. You will never lose access to this program and once you buy it, you’ll automatically get access to new lessons and material as it becomes available, free of charge. I plan on adding new content every year. 3. LOCATION RESTRICTIONS This is open internationally! 4. YIN YOGA BOOK Your tuition includes a copy of my book Yin Yoga. This book will be shipped to you via Amazon. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR SHIPPING! Don’t worry, I’m covering those charges, I’ve factored that in to your tuition :) The average shipment time should be about 5 business days but some areas of the world might take longer. There are a few areas where Amazon does not deliver: North Korea, Somalia, Cuba, Iran, Botswana, Iraq, and Myanmar 5. DO I NEED FACEBOOK? No, not at all. Eventually I might create a private facebook group for students but for now I want to keep things as simple as possible. 😍 ONLINE YIN YOGA TEACHER TRAINING 😍 Get certified to teach!

In today's video I wanted to address a question I've gotten hundreds of times over the past 5 years and I'm so sorry it's taken me so long to address it! Is Yin Yoga the same as Restorative Yoga? The answer is NO, they are not the same. HOWEVER, they have a lot of similarities! Yin yoga comes from Taoism and Traditional Chinese Medicine whereas Restorative Yoga comes from Hatha Yoga. The intention of Yin Yoga is to clear energetic blockages and work on the connective tissues of the body. The intention of Restorative yoga is to soothe the parasympathetic nervous system and bring you back to an optimal level of wellbeing. They are similar because they both use passive poses held for an extended period of time and there is often an overlap in the poses.

The biggest game changer for me in my own practice was tapping into my core strength. Once I was diligent and consistent in working on ab, back and hip flexor strength, I saw huge improvements in the rest of my practice. Not that it matters whether or not you ""advance"" your practice, but it is nice to feel more stability in standing poses and have a smoother time with transitions. If you practice these 5 yoga poses every day or as often as you can, I guarantee you will see major improvement!

Whether you have back pain or just want to improve your overall spine flexibility, these are my favorite poses that target the area. You'll want to have two blocks close by for this practice or some large couch cushions. We'll play with lateral flexion, extension and spinal rotation. This class is suitable for all experience levels. Remember that if it hurts, you've gone too far! Never force your way into a pose and come out of it early if you need to. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student.

I've put off making it simply because lotus pose isn't always safe for many people's knees. No matter how advanced in your practice you may be, some poses might simply not feel good and that's okay! If you'd like to try this flow for yourself, please do so very mindfully. For some, lotus pose feels great and puts no strain on the knees. For others, it's painful and detrimental to their practice. Let's always make sure we do things because they FEEL GOOD rather than because they LOOK GOOD. Okay, moving on from that disclaimer... This pose will focus on deep hip openers, especially external hip rotation to prepare you for lotus. We'll start with a stronger standing series before settling into some seated hip openers. I would say it is an intermediate to advanced practice.

As you most likely know, yin yoga tends to be quite prop intensive using blocks, straps, bolsters, blankets and many other items that you might not always have around. If you're travelling or just low on props, this yin yoga class will take you through a 40 minute sequence you can do without equipment! Of course, I'm a big lover of props so always recommend having them close by, but this is a nice class to do in a pinch :) What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose.

For about a month, I was couch-bound and unable to do basic things like get in and out of bed, walk, clean, cook, drive, etc let alone do yoga!

I learned a lot about myself and others through this process and wanted to share with you the main lessons I learned from this injury. I know it's a bit of a long video, I have a tendency to talk a lot! Believe it or not, it was actually closer to 50 minutes before I edited it!!! I'd love to hear from you... Have you been injured?

As with all my chakra classes, we'll be pairing yin yoga poses with affirmations. This is a great way to recognize areas you need to work on. All you need to do is repeat the affirmations and notice how they make you feel. If they are uncomfortable or difficult to hear, this might be an indication that there is a wound here which needs healing. The third eye chakra relates to our intuition, our spiritual connection and our ability to get in touch with our highest self. This is the seat of your imagination and insight. We'll begin with a meditation and pranayama exercise followed by a few poses that put pressure on the third eye. Grab a few blocks and a journal to get started. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

The throat chakra is all about clear communication. Do you speak your truth? Are you open to other people's opinions? How do you use your body language? These are all themes that have to do with balancing the throat chakra. The poses in this class will target the neck, upper back and shoulders. It's a yummy flow that only requires a few blocks. I would encourage you to also have a pen and paper so that you can note down any thoughts that came to you during practice. As many of you know, I love to pair yin yoga with affirmations as a way of doing shadow work. Notice how you feel when you repeat affirmations. If they feel uncomfortable or difficult, it could be an indication that there is more work for you to do around this theme.

Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student.

It's been a long journey to recovery but I'm getting better every day and in a few weeks I should be back to my regular practice! (This video was filmed about 2 weeks ago) A huge part of my rehabilitation journey has been to diligently stretch and strengthen my knee every single day, no exceptions! I'm also in athletic therapy once or twice a week and see my doctor quite frequently. PLEASE NOTE that it is EXTREMELY important that you consult with your health care team before copying what I'm doing! Knee injuries are VERY different from person to person so what I'm doing may not work for you. That being said, here's my 30 minute stretching routine for injured knees. It mainly focuses on stretching out the quads, hamstrings and hip flexors which can become incredibly stiff and tight when our knees get injured. Since I have a bone bruise I can't do any poses on hands and knees but if you're able to do it at home, I would recommend doing a low lunge with a quad stretch to really get into the knee!

Using blocks is one of the best ways we can evolve our yoga practice. While blocks are a wonderful way to help bridge the gap between your body and the floor, there are so many other ways they can be used! In my new 30 minute intermediate vinyasa flow YouTube yoga class I show you how blocks can be used to strengthen the midline for more balance and strength.

No props needed. 🎓 STUDY WITH ME 🧘 VINYASA TEACHING METHODOLOGIES 🎓 👉 https://bit.ly/yttvinyasa ❤️ Try my mobile app to get exclusive content! ❤️📱 👉 http://bit.ly/ytmobileapp Hey yogis, by popular request here's a quick 15 minute yin yoga stretch for your extremities. This sequence will target your hands, fingers and wrists as well as your feet and ankles. We also include a few neck stretches. Since the extremities are vulnerable and sensitive we don't hold these poses quite as long as others in yin yoga. This is great for anyone with carpal tunnel syndrome! What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student.

The solar plexus chakra is all about confidence, self-esteem, self-worth and desirability. The intention behind this sequence is to help you find balance between confidence and humility. If you've done my chakra classes before you know that I like to use affirmations to help you highlight any areas that may be wounded or need some work. While in the pose, simply listen to the affirmation and repeat it back a few times to see how it makes you feel. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Find your edge means respecting your body's limits and not pushing too far and risking injury. Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose.

This week I'm expanding my Yin Yoga chakra series with the 2nd chakra which deals with the emotional body, creativity and sensuality. The sacral/svadhisthana chakra is located in the pelvis, under the belly button and above the pubic bone. It is associated with the color orange. This yin yoga class is all about opening up the area of the hips to release stuck or stagnant energy and increase flexibility. This chakra is associated with creativity, passion, sensuality, sexuality and your emotions. I like to work with affirmations so for each asana, I'll ask you to internally repeat an affirmation and notice how it makes you feel. Keep a journal close by to write down how certain poses and affirmations made you feel. This is an intense practice. Have lots of props close by and be kind to yourself! What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints.

I want yoga to be a refuge that you can turn to when you feel bad about yourself. Your yoga mat should be a place of solace where you don't need to worry about how you look or how much you weigh. In this practice we will use a lot of touch to learn to love ourselves and we will offer a deep prayer to women of the world. May we all learn to love our beautiful bodies that do so much for us. Cherish this vehicle that carries you through life, that births babies, that allows you to experience this world. This body that has done so much for you and has overcome even more! LOVE IT. This is an all-levels flow suitabe for any man or woman who wants to erase the negative inner dialogue from their minds. Let's change the conversation and love ourselves inside out.

This class will use yin yoga poses and affirmations to help you connect to this chakra and clear out any blockages you may have around it. We begin with the Root Chakra, located at the base of the spine and associated with the color red. This chakra is associated with our sense of safety, security and belonging. It deals with scarcity or abundance mindsets and relates to the first stage of infancy when we rely on our parents to care for our needs. To have a balanced root chakra means that you feel safe and confident and don't worry about ""not having enough"". The poses we'll be doing are targeted for the lower body such as the feet, quads and hamstrings. Have some blocks and a journal close by. What is Yin Yoga?

This is a special time of the year that I feel many people misunderstand. The Winter solstice is a paradox. It marks the longest night of the year as well as the return of sunlight as we move towards Spring. The last thing we want to do during the Winter solstice is overexert ourselves! This time of the year is all about resting, saying no, sleeping and tuning in to what we truly want. A flower is not meant to blossom year round and we aren't either. Winter is a time for us to hibernate physically, mentally and emotionally. While we can't actually sleep for months, Winter is a beautiful opportunity to reduce the amount of activities, tasks and stresses you normally have. The magical thing about honoring winter by slowing down and resting more is that it will make you more productive and full of energy come Spring and Summer! We burn out when we try to GO GO GO year-round... It isn't sustainable! In this restorative yoga practice I'll ask you to stop trying to do everything and learn to do nothing. Restorative yoga is not about chasing sensation but about restoring yourself to optimal health and soothing the nervous system. The winter solstice is a time of darkness and death which are necessary so that we may be reborn in the springtime with fresh ideas and new perspectives. Have plenty of props around you like pillows, bolsters, blankets and blocks and keep a journal close by. You'll be prompted to dream, visualize and imagine what you want your life to be like. This is such a wonderful time of the year and I really hope you'll make the most of it by doing WAY LESS. Take some bubble baths, sleep more, eat more and learn to say NO. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

The element of air is associated with the heart chakra and the space of the lungs. This class is all about ""opening to receive the breath"". When we tap into the element of air, we open ourselves up to the world and allow ourselves to connect to our own life force and to all other living beings in the world. This is a beautiful practice to do when you feel disconnected or lonely as it will remind you that no matter how far friends & family may be, we are all breathing the same air. The element of air is also great for inspiring creativity and getting in touch with your spirituality. The flow itself will take you through poses that open up the chest and upper back in all directions through backbends, twists and lateral stretches. A lot of the poses will have clasped hands so you may want to have a strap and a block close by.

Instead of letting external circumstances dictate how your day will go, choose to decide when you wake up!

This class was a special request from one of my subscribers and focuses on opening up the quads, thighs and hips flexors. There aren't very many yin yoga poses that focus on the quads, but there are four and those are the ones we'll be doing today. The poses include: laying quad stretch, twisted lizard/dragon, reclined hero and cat pulling it's tail. The quadriceps are big muscles at the front of the thighs that can get quite tight, especially for athletes. This practice will target the entire front of the thigh, from the hip flexors all the way down to the top of the knee. This is a great yin yoga class to do if you have knee tension, although people with acute knee injuries should not practice this! Make sure you have lots of props such as a blanket, two blocks and a strap. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

For well over a year now I've been working hard behind the scenes to write a book on a topic I am passionate about, yin yoga! I'm so happy to say that ""Yin Yoga - Stretch the Mindful Way"" is now available for pre-order on Amazon and will be available in stores on December 12th, just in time for the holidays :) This book is an illustrated guide to the healing practice of yin yoga. It includes: • More than 50 step-by-step poses that focus on specific areas of the body • 20 sequences linking the poses, designed to help readers reach specific physical, mental, or emotional goals • Introductory information on the basic techniques and philosophies behind yin yoga, including correct breathing techniques, chakras and meridians, and how best to practice yin yoga This is BY FAR the hardest project I've ever worked on.. It was stressful and unlike anything I had ever imagined, but I'm really proud of the results. The book is published by DK Books and is a fantastic introduction to the practice of Yin Yoga. Yin yoga offers a remedy to the stress and hustle of your busy yang life. By concentrating on restorative poses that target your deeper fascia and connective tissues, you’ll experience increased flexibility and improved joint health. Yin yoga also focuses on deep breathing and longer hold times, allowing you the time and space to clear your mind and enhance your mental acuity. These meditative poses will help you attain a renewed sense of mindfulness and physical well-being, making them the perfect complement to an active yang lifestyle and helping bring you back into balance. ❤️ Buy my *NEW* YIN YOGA book ❤️ http://geni.us/ywkbook ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

I'm currently in Costa Rica on vacation and haven't had a chance to film a full length yoga class this week, however I still wanted to share a little pose tutorial. I was recently asked to breakdown Grasshopper pose, which is a fairly tricky arm balance. Like most arm balances, it requires strong shoulders and an engaged core. If you can do a few chaturanga pushups and can do crow pose, you should be able to attempt this one! There are a few ways to get into it but I find the easiest one to be from standing pigeon pose. From standing pigeon, you need to rotate your torso in order to ground the palms on the floor, shoulder-width distance apart. Then, it's all about leaning the weight into your arms with bent elbows as if you were doing Chaturanga and lifting the legs. I personally found this one really tricky when I was first learning it so don't get discouraged if it doesn't work right away. Engage your legs as much as possible to prevent the bent knee from slipping down your arm. Tone the navel, gaze forward and hug to the midline to stay strong and balanced in the pose.

What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3.

The element of fire is associated with destruction, transformation, passion and energy. It is also closely related to our self-esteem, self-confidence and our digestion. When unbalanced and underactive, we are low energy, lethargic and have a hard time making decisions and reaching our goals. When unbalanced and overactive, we are quick to anger, frazzled and destructive. This class is meant to help you find balance with the element of fire!

This slow flow yoga class is in honor of the Autumn equinox and the changing of the seasons. This is a fluid and circular practice to reflect on the cyclical nature of the seasons. The Fall Equinox falls around September 20-22nd every year and it's my favorite season! Energetically, Fall is the time where we start to turn in. Spring and Summer are a time for us to be outgoing, social and energetic whereas Fall and Winter are a time for us to turn inward, relax, regenerate and reflect. This Autumn Equinox is your opportunity to bring balance back into our lives. This practice will combine balance poses (to find balance in our lives), forward folds (to let go of frustration and disappointments) and hip openers (to open ourselves to possibilities).

This 90 minute yin yoga practice will help you increase flexibility in your hips and hamstrings. You will need to have 2 blocks as well as a strap for this class. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

Twists are a wonderful way to alleviate discomfort in your spine. Whenever I get a knot in my back or pain in my lower back, a few gentle twists always make me feel brand new again. We'll also play with some fun balancing poses and try new variations of classic poses such as high lunge and downward dog. Twists also have a ""detoxing"" nature which although sounds a bit out there, all it means is that you are compressing and decompressing the internal organs to facilitate the process of elimination. Twists are also a wonderful way to get a natural boost of energy! Instead of reaching for that 2nd cup of coffee, why not do a 30 minute slow flow twist class? This is an intermediate level class however we move through the poses fairly slowly so this would be a good class for beginner students trying to transition to intermediate level. Some of the poses are a bit harder such as standing pigeon with a twist and boat pose, feel free to skip those out! Some of the poses we'll be playing with include laying spinal twist, revolved triangle, high lunge twist and many more! Sorry if the footage is slightly blurry, it looks like the lens was not quite in focus!

This week I've decided to do an advanced Yin Yoga practice using a yoga wheel :) My little cat Cleo also pays us a visit in this class, she was fascinated by the wheel! Buy a Yoga wheel: http://amzn.to/2vqmQ9o *note, the link above is an affiliate link! This 40 minute Yin Yoga practice using a yoga wheel will help you get into some very deep backbends, working our way into Kapotasana pose. This practice is NOT suitable for beginners and definitely not suitable for anyone with a slipped or herniated disc!!! The poses we'll be doing include: - Supported Fish - Modified Supported Bridge - Supported Bridge - Waterfall - Puppy - Splits - Kapotasana/Full Camel Pose This is a great class to do if you're trying to improve your backbends and increase overall flexibility. We will open up the shoulders, chest, hamstrings and hip flexors while also deepening the range of motion in the spine. What do you think of the yoga wheel? Is it a prop you enjoy using? I've had mine for a while now and tend to only use it for deep backbends like the ones done in this class. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Crow Pose (or Bakasana in Sanskrit) is what I would call the foundational arm balance pose. Most other arm balances are built off of this first pose so it's an important one to master if you eventually want to start doing more inversions and arm balances. When my teacher first showed me crow pose I thought she was crazy and didn't think it would be something I would ever be able to do on my own. It seemed impossible! It took a very very VERY long time for me to be able to do this pose so don't get discouraged if it doesn't work for you right away! In this video I'll show you how I get into crow pose and I'll give you tips & tricks you can do with a block if you are afraid of falling. At the end of the day you will need to have strong arms and a strong core while also being able to use your hands and wrists properly to balance. Fear plays a big part in arm balances so be kind to yourself and take the pressure off.

(Or as some people call it, middle splits). If you have tightness in your inner groin and hamstrings this class will definitely do the trick. If practiced regularly, you will notice a lot of improvement in your flexibility. I plan on doing this routine a few times a week myself as middle/side splits are a big weakness of mine and something I want to improve on! You'll need 2 blocks and a blanket in order to do this practice. I was joined by my little kitty Kitkat :) What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

I'll show you my two favorite ways of doing Fallen Angel, the first way is to enter it from Side Crow and the other way is from Eka Pada Koundinyasana 2. Before attempting this pose, you should be able to do crow pose, side crow and eka pada 1 and 2. If those poses aren't yet in your repertoire, hold off before attempting this one otherwise you will hurt yourself. Good conditioning to build up strength includes chaturanga pushups, core work and playing around with crow pose. Sorry I got so out of breath in this tutorial!

We'll begin with a very short meditation to be grounded and then warming up the spine with some fluid motions. We'll then move to hands and knees and start to engage the abdominals which is key when it comes to improving balance. Our flows will take you through a Warrior sequence where we focus on alignment and breath to do the poses safely and effectively.

Don't worry about always being still, always being thought-free or meditating ""perfectly"". Simply sit and breathe, that's it! Over time the spaces between your thoughts will distance themselves but there's no need to rush or force it. Make sure you are sitting comfortably, either on a block or a few blankets. You can even sit on a chair if sitting on a floor doesn't work for you!

This is all about backbends and poses that open up the heart and shoulders. This is NOT appropriate for anyone with spine injuries such as bulging or herniated discs!! I cannot state this enough! I would say that this is an advanced Yin Yoga class. You need 2 blocks in order to do this practice and if you have a cat, even better ;) We'll play with poses like Sphinx, Seal, Supported Fish and Lying Chest Opener. My cat Cleo joins us for most of it, isn't she adorable?? Practicing this class and these postures on a regular basis is a surefire way to deepen your backbends and increase your back flexibility. If you're working on Bow Pose, Wheel or any other backbending pose, this class will help you get there. Because it's so intense, you need to be able to stay present with your breath and BACK OFF if it's too much! Again, this is SO important. The goal is not to injure ourselves.

Most of the posts will help you open up the entire area from the side of the neck all the way down into the ankles. We will also play around with quite a few balancing poses! Many poses in yoga strengthen the obliques and IT band but we very rarely stretch these muscle groups which can become tight and overused. By unlocking and opening up the side body we can improve our posture and get a boost of energy. This is a wonderful class to do if you spend long hours working at a desk. This is an intermediate level class that will play with poses like crescent moon, triangle, half moon, exhalted warrior and many variations of child's pose, downward dog, tree pose and more to properly open up the side body. While this is a class focusing on ""stretch"" and is a feel good flow, you can still expect to get a workout and put some effort into this practice!

This is a 60 minute yoga class that will help you improve flexibility in the lower body. Hip openers are some of the most intense yin yoga asanas there are, so it's important to respect your limits and use props! In this class I'll be using 2 blocks but you may also want to have some pillows and bolsters close by just in case. PRINCIPLES OF YIN YOGA: https://youtu.be/xyAY1zyuDeg What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far. Thanks for watching, please remember to subscribe!

The poses covered in this class focus on the inner thighs, hip flexors, the chest and the side body. The spleen and stomach meridians go together quite well which is why I paired them for this class. The spleen meridian moves from the inner leg up to the outer part of the ribcage and chest while the stomach meridian runs along the front of the leg and front of the chest. We will do poses like low lunge (baby dragon), sphinx and banana pose. In Chinese medicine it is believed that a healthy spleen meridian is associated with trust, honesty and healthy digestion. The stomach meridian influences our mental states and also supports the digestion process. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

Pull back a little bit and as you hold the pose you will be able to go deeper into it without pushing too far or hurting yourself. Being still means that once you are in the pose it is important to completely relax your muscles so the benefits can get into the connective tissues and joints. Try not to fidget or move or distract yourself, this is a meditative practice. Breathe deeply in and out through the nose. Holding the pose means that in Yin Yoga a pose can be held for 1-10 minutes depending on the pose performed and on the comfort level of the student. I usually teach poses held for around 4-5 minutes. Learn to surrender and keep a timer close by if needed. Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga!

I'm collaborating with Dr. Melissa West from Yoga with Melissa to bring you a beginner hatha yoga class called, Beginner Yoga for the Inflexible. Yoga is about so much more than flexibility. It is about shifting your awareness from the external demands of the world into a more embodied internal awareness and focus. Through yoga you can connect to your breath, release physical, mental, emotional and energetic tension. You can build strength, and increase your mobility and balance. Today’s yoga class is a beginner’s yoga class for complete beginners. In this yoga class I will offer lots of modifications and explain the benefits of each pose. I offer easy to follow, step by step yoga poses. The class begins with a preview of all the poses so that you will know that this is a class you can do. In this yoga class you will increase mobility in your hip joints, Through movement you will expand the capacity of your breath by opening your intercostal, back and chest muscles and increase the awareness of your breath as you coordinate your breath and movement. Through yoga postures you will build strength in your core, glutes, hamstrings, legs, ankles, back, We will practice yoga postures to increase the mobility of your spine and release tension in your spine and central nervous system. There are several yoga postures in this class to improve your balance. We will begin and end with guided relaxation to release stress and strain from your body, mind, and emotions.

To really benefit the liver we are working with two different meridian lines, the liver and the gall bladder meridian. These poses will mostly focus on the hips (as do most Yin Yoga asanas) but they will also include some side body stretches to really target that organ. You will hopefully feel rejuvenated and energized after class! I won't be using any props during class but you may want to have 1 block close by just in case, some of the hip openers are pretty intense! The meridians are energetic pathways from Chinese Medicine that help flow Qi (pronounced chee) through the body. This is a vital energy source that helps support organ health, longevity and overall vitality. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

This year I figured I should film the process and show you what I do step by step so that you can do the same thing at home! I'm a big believer in writing down your dreams and goals and every year I'm astonished when I look back and see exactly how many of my goals actually came true! No matter how ""bad"" you think this year has been, I guarantee that if you do this process you'll feel a LOT better about your year. It's easy to forget all the wonderful things we did and achieved over the past 12 months but going through it is a wonderful way to close the chapter on that year before starting a new one. I like to use Danielle Laporte's areas of life from The Desire Map to set goals. The areas are: 1. Livelihood and Lifestyle 2. Body & Wellness 3. Creativity & Learning 4. Relationships & Society 5. Essence & Spirituality This gives me a really broad overview of how I want the year to go in those different areas of life. I'm not a fan of resolutions because I think they are depressing and negative, but I always list my goals and set an intention for the year ahead. In 2016 my intention was Collaboration and for 2017 my intention is Focus & Prioritize!

This is more than just a yoga class where we stretch and strengthen. Instead, this class calls on us to dive a little bit deeper and use our yoga practice to make meaningful changes in our daily lives. The Seven Chakras: - Root Chakra/Muladhara: safety, survival, community & family - Sacral Chakra/Svadhisthana: creativity, sexuality, relationships - Naval Chakra/Manipura: self-esteem, confidence, individuality - Heart Chakra/Anahata: love, caring, oneness, acceptance - Throat Chakra/Visuddha: truth, clear communication, integrity - Third Eye Chakra/Ajna: wisdom, intuition, guidance - Crown Chakra/Sahasrara: divine connection, spirituality, oneness with all I hope you find this class beneficial in some way. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

If you spend many hours sitting at a desk or do a lot of running, chances are you have tight hip flexors. In this class we will focus not only on stretching the hip flexors but also strengthening them. Just because a muscle is tight does not mean it is strong! I can personally say that having tight hip flexors negatively affected my posture for years and out of all the yoga poses, lunges are my favorite. On days where I am busy or can't motivate myself to get on my mat and practice yoga, I still do a few lunges. If you suffer from low back pain I encourage you to do these types of movements regularly and see how you feel. The hip flexors are a huge part of your core which most people don't realize! You can expect to do a lot of lunges, side bends, half moon pose, warrior 2, lizard, supported bridge and dancer's pose in this class. It's an intermediate sequence so students should be familiar with Vinyasa's and flows. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Twists are often associated with detoxing and although that may sound like a bunch of nonsense, all that's really meant by this is that twists support the natural process of digestion and elimination by compression and decompressing the internal organs.

Two of the poses are poses I've never taught on youtube before so I hope you will enjoy them. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them.

A big part of loneliness has to do with perception, if we can just shift our focus to what we have as oppose to what we lack we can start to see that we are connected to so many people in many different ways.

This meditation is not about cheering up or looking on the bright side. It's about sitting with a feeling without letting it overwhelm and drown you. There's a lot of depth in sadness and grief and a lot of wisdom. It's a grounding feeling that puts you back in touch with the things that really matter, your true priorities. It also opens you up to compassion and helps you relate to others who are going through the same thing as you in a way that you wouldn't have understood before. Let's sit with our emotions and simply observe how they feel in our bodies, how they make us breathe and how they make us react. We will try to be the observer instead of the doer, breathing softly throughout the process. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Forgiving others for the wrong they have done to us does not mean that we think what they did it's okay, we just understand that we are all imperfect beings and we make the choice to move forward in our lives. Holding onto grudges and resentment only hurts us and not the person who wronged us. To forgive others is to give ourselves permission to stop hurting ourselves in the present for something that was done in the past. The other side of this is learning to forgive ourselves. The key to this is acknowledging that we are all perfectly imperfect beings doing the best we can. We've all wronged someone at some point in our life and mulling over that shame and guilt will not recreate the past. Forgiving ourselves for our shortcomings is the only way to move forward in life and find peace. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

Unfortunately the live recording I did didn't work on youtube, so I had to upload the live facebook recording for today's meditation. Today the intention and focus was on productivity and getting things done in an efficient and clear way. We all get overwhelmed at times and when we have a lot of things to do, it can be hard to quiet down our minds and stay peaceful. Today is a big day for me so I thought it would be fitting to focus our meditation on efficient productivity. I'll take you through a body scan to help you relax and settle in to your body and then we will move on to the quiet meditation. We close our meditation together by setting an intention, mine was ""I am easily and effortlessly productive"". It's always a good idea to have a journal close by to write down any insights that may have come up for you. I'm also going to encourage you to make a ""to do"" list so that you can get out of your own head and get really clear. ✅ SUBSCRIBE TO SUPPORT FREE YOGA ON THE INTERNET http://bit.ly/ywkassandra 🔔 Don’t forget to click on the bell to turn on post notifications!

This is a very restorative practice that will help you release tension in the neck and shoulders while increasing flexibility in the hips and hamstrings. Using the wall for support is a great way to minimize the effort required while in the poses so that you can relax, let go and enter a meditative state. Enjoy! What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

They help open up the side of the neck, shoulder, ribcage, waist and IT band. These are often neglected areas of our bodies and releasing them is a wonderful way to feel lighter and a lot more comfortable! I'm not using props in this practice but you might want to have a block or two close by. This is a 45 minute yin yoga class but be sure to give yourself an extra few minutes at the end to enjoy a longer savasana. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

Stretch out your hips, shoulders, hamstrings and low back with this lovely sequence that will leave you feeling rejuvenated and comfortable in your own body. You will need two blocks for this practice and a blanket is optional but nice to have. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more felxibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counterintuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

Start in standing pigeon, then drop your palms to the floor in chaturanga arms, pick up the back leg and slowly extend back. The key here is to lean your head and chest far forward to take the weight out of the lower body. The more weight you can put into the arms the easier it will be to get the hips high up!

In this class we will be focusing almost exclusively on twists which help to compress and decompress the internal organs and colon to soothe bloating, cramps, indigestion and constipation. I am not using any props for this class and most of it will be done lying on our backs. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

Even if splits is not a part of your practice, these long held stretches will drastically improve your hip, hamstring and quad flexibility, all of which are required for the splits. You will need a block or two as well as a strap for this class. If you have a smaller bolster, grab that too! What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

Please have a block handy for this practice. My cat Cleo also makes a special guest appearance :) What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

This class will explore postures that open up the body deeply and help improve flexibility. This sequence utilizes deep hip opening yoga stretches. We will play with poses like firefly, lizard, star and double pigeon. You will need two blocks for this class. Enjoy and please remember to subscribe! What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

Hi everyone, this is an old video that seems to have a copyright claim on it because of the music. The music owner is the one monetizing the video and placing ads on it because they own the rights to the song. This was done in error and now I am unable to turn off the mid-roll ads. My only other option is to take off the video from YouTube completely. Very sorry about this! I encourage you to try my other yin yoga videos which DO NOT have ads in them: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0v0k7UCVrmK5WvoJMCAof0LJxuQXqxk Filmed in beautiful San Francisco, California. Recharge your batteries with this restorative yin yoga class that will leave you feeling stress free, open and relaxed. Most of our poses will be done lying down with no props needed. This is a 35 minute class suitable for all levels. We will open up the chest, stretch out the hamstrings with passive folds and relieve lower back pain with simple twists. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

It was my first time doing it and it was incredibly hard. I was also really surprised to see how closely it related to yoga! Looking at the experienced surfers I could see how they were moving in ways that resembled yoga poses like cobra, locust and some warriors. This 30 minute class is designed to help you strengthen the muscles you need to utilize while surfing while also giving them a chance to stretch and be supported by other areas of the body so they don't become overused. We will play with a lot of backbends and back strengtheners, do some core abdominal work and spend the last 15 minute of the class opening up the hips, hamstrings and shoulders. I hope you enjoy it.

This Yin Yoga class is designed to help you bring movement back into that area and leave you feeling open and relaxed. We'll intertwine a few hip openers throughout the class as to not completely ignore the lower body. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more flexibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. Although your muscles will also be stretched, that is not the focus of the practice. It is best to practice yin yoga while your muscles are cold and NOT warmed up, even if that sounds counter intuitive. The reason we do this is so that we can send the ""stress"" and the ""Stretch"" to the connective tissues. If the muscles are warm they will steal the focus away from the joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.

Yin yoga is a great way to improve flexibility, release stress and calm down the nervous system. There will be minimal verbal cuing in this practice to allow for deep inner focus and meditation. Make sure you have 2 blocks and a strap and maybe grab a blanket for savasana. What is Yin Yoga? Yin yoga is often called the Yoga of the joints because unlike other styles of yoga, the emphasis is not on the muscles but on the deep connective tissue. Connective tissue is made up of fascia, ligaments and tendons which surround and form your joints. Yin yoga improves the range of motion in your joints and also strengthens them. The results and benefits are more felxibility and greater range of motion and also more stability within your joints. There are 3 principles of Yin Yoga. 1. Find your edge 2. Be still 3. Hold the pose Use as many props as needed in Yin Yoga! Blocks, bolsters and straps are all great ways to support your body to make sure you are respecting your edge and not going too far.
